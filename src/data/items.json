Unfortunately, in many of our traditional ways of delivering infrastructure, we create barriers between these people who actually care desperately about climate change.&rdquo;\n\n<h2><br \/>\nThe Opportunities: It&rsquo;s Possible to Make a Change Today<\/h2>\n\n<div>9.<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> <\/span>The costs involved in taking the first step toward sustainable business practices&nbsp;<strong style=\"font-weight:700\">are lower than you&rsquo;d think.<\/strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;<a href=\"https:\/\/rmi.org\/insight\/reducing-embodied-carbon-in-buildings\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">RMI<\/a>&nbsp;recently did a study where they quantified the embodied carbon reduction opportunities within the building sector across three different building types, and also what that premium would be,&rdquo; revealed Katie Ross,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">Microsoft&rsquo;s<\/a>&nbsp;Global Real Estate Facilities and Sustainability Lead. &ldquo;They found that you can achieve a&nbsp;<strong style=\"font-weight:700\">19%&ndash;46% reduction<\/strong>&nbsp;in embodied carbon with less than 1 % cost premium.&rdquo;<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>10.<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> <\/span>There&rsquo;s huge potential for private and public sector stakeholders to form key partnerships that will help achieve sustainable outcomes. &ldquo;The private sector is in support of public sector leadership to make these climate commitments, make them clear and help us line up to deliver on them,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/recent-content\/climate-action-planning-for-leaders-don-t-do-less-bad-enable-more-good\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">Joe Speicher<\/a>, Head of Sustainability &amp; Foundation at Autodesk. &ldquo;Companies [need]&nbsp;<strong style=\"font-weight:700\">clear signals<\/strong>&nbsp;from governments,&rdquo; agreed Eliano Russo, Head of E-Industries at Enel X. &ldquo;As this becomes a genuine priority for all governments, then we can act &hellip; and I think we as businesses play a crucial role in [trying to translate this political willingness into action].&rdquo;<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>11.<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> <\/span>There are, however, hidden costs to sustainability that everyone should consider. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really important to measure the&nbsp;<strong style=\"font-weight:700\">true cost of being circular<\/strong>,&rdquo; said Didier Tshidimba, Senior Partner,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rolandberger.com\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">Roland Berger<\/a>. &ldquo;If you look at bottle recycling you would need to clean and melt plastic again to produce new bottles&hellip;if you don&rsquo;t have the right product, the right solvent&hellip;it&rsquo;s more expensive but also more harmful to the environment to try to recycle. The same applies for aluminum. We found some suppliers who are really into supplying recycled aluminum&hellip;but we need to scale that and we&rsquo;re not there yet.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>12.<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> <\/span>Taking advantage of technology will help the industry with decarbonization. &ldquo;We believe that&nbsp;<strong style=\"font-weight:700\">digitalization, automation, sensors, data analytics&nbsp;<\/strong>... we have to have all of these things together to eke out that next level of gains for decarbonizing the built environment,&rdquo; said Scott Tew, Vice President of Sustainability at Trane Technologies.<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>13.<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> <\/span><strong style=\"font-weight:700\">Better data management&nbsp;<\/strong>is also key to achieving sustainability goals. Edward Kulperger, Senior Vice President, Europe,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.geotab.com\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">Geotab<\/a>, said: &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re just scratching the surface in terms of the value that the datasets coming from infrastructure, energy, and transportation can provide in a socioeconomic benefit to our communities today.&rdquo;<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>14.<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> <\/span>Landlords, however, need to be put under pressure to provide more data. &ldquo;Getting&nbsp;<strong style=\"font-weight:700\">access to data<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong style=\"font-weight:700\">is very challenging<\/strong>&nbsp;in a lease space,&rdquo; said Microsoft&rsquo;s Katie Ross. &ldquo;That is something that we are really pushing the conversation with our landlords...being able to have the data around energy, water, and waste&hellip; once we have that data, we can measure it, manage it and ultimately help reduce it to meet our climate goals.&rdquo;<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>15.<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> <\/span>Using tools like the Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.buildingtransparency.org\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">EC3<\/a>) to measure embodied carbon in the making of the building is an actionable way to make better decisions. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re thinking about the design, certainly when you&rsquo;re planning the construction of something,&nbsp;<strong style=\"font-weight:700\">measure the carbon<\/strong>,&rdquo; said Mike Haigh, CEO of Mott MacDonald. &ldquo;Really work out where the carbon hot spots are. Chances are if you do that you&rsquo;ll come up with different ways of working which will save carbon &ndash; but you know what, it will save costs as well.&rdquo;<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>16.<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> <\/span>Decarbonization and electrification need to be considered as part of the collective future. But don&rsquo;t forget about&nbsp;<strong style=\"font-weight:700\">resilience<\/strong><strong style=\"font-weight:700\">&mdash;<\/strong>or about&nbsp;<strong style=\"font-weight:700\">circularity<\/strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong style=\"font-weight:700\">how materials are used<\/strong>&nbsp;in the world. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing talking about decarbonizing a material,&rdquo; said Haigh. &ldquo;But we should also talk about using that material in a more efficient way or using different materials.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\n\n<div>17.<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> <\/span>There&rsquo;s no reason to stop at net-zero. &ldquo;We are working on many projects where the building is actually a&nbsp;<strong style=\"font-weight:700\">producer of energy&nbsp;<\/strong>&hellip; that&rsquo;s a great trend that we see more innovative building owners and operators coming to us to ask for,&rdquo; said Tomas Brannemo, Vice President and President, Building Solutions,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsoncontrols.com\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">Johnson Controls<\/a>.\n\n<h2><br \/>\nWhat Are Governments Doing?

There&rsquo;s also a growing realization that digital transformation and sustainability are inexorably linked. That confluence is having an impact on corporate strategy.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>But what does digital sustainability actually mean? It&rsquo;s about more than energy-efficient data centers or establishing greener supply chains. It&rsquo;s a holistic approach to building net-zero, water-conscious, wildlife protecting, and otherwise planet-friendly business operations through technology. It looks beyond the core capabilities of software and digital platforms and considers how the efficiencies they deliver can be leveraged for a complementary sustainable outcome.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In practice, it could mean the use of IoT sensors to make building&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heating,_ventilation,_and_air_conditioning\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">HVAC systems<\/a>&nbsp;&ldquo;smart,&rdquo; optimizing energy use by switching on and off according to occupancy levels on each floor and public area. Another use case could be leveraging digital design tools to identify and stress-test sustainable raw materials for manufacturing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Those are just two examples from a growing list of real-world applications.

They discussed the impact of the pandemic and other macroeconomic, technology and industry factors on their customers and their companies, as well as what they intend to bring forward into 2021 and beyond. Following are their insights and predictions.<\/p>\n\n<h2>1. Business continuity and resilience are no longer an activity&mdash;they&rsquo;re a mindset<\/h2>\n\n<p>The discussion focused on a number of expected themes: financial uncertainty, slowing investment decisions, geopolitical pressures, competition, impacts to supply chain and projects overall. But leaders also shared what they have learned from the past 10 months; for example, the need to re-evaluate business continuity plans to account for employee, customer and workplace impacts, as well as the &ldquo;unknown unknowns&rdquo; that have changed how, where and when we work. The concern, said some leaders, is that, once the pandemic is over, they will return to the old ways and be vulnerable&shy; to the same types of disruption again.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>In 2021, expect to see business continuity strategies shift from a focus on crisis response to an imperative for organizational resilience more broadly.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<h2>2. Increased focus on creativity and social connection as competitive advantage<\/h2>\n\n<p>This year we learned that many businesses&nbsp;<em>can<\/em>&nbsp;work remotely; just in different ways. Some of the most prominent issues of remote work are the highly concrete and specific (connectivity, equipment, physical workspace), while others are less tangible.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, how does distributed work affect culture in the longer term? Can we provide experiences that are as satisfying and engaging digitally as they are in the physical world? How can we design hybrid work environments fairly and in a way that sustains creativity and minimizes fatigue? This is especially important given that many employees now expect distributed work to become a permanent fixture in their lives.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>In 2021, expect increased focus on improving the experience of remote work, especially ways to promote organizational cohesion, trust and relationships in digital and hybrid environments.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<h2>3. Operationalizing distributed work for the long term<\/h2>\n\n<p>Work\/life balance&mdash;which seemed to improve at the beginning of the pandemic as people gained back their commute times&mdash;now appears more like burnout as employees &ldquo;donate&rdquo; commute time to work and struggle to navigate an increasingly blurred line between their work and personal lives. As a result, leaders are spending more time on communicating, checking in and monitoring staff welfare and morale. Is this sustainable? From a pace perspective, probably not. But it is likely to give rise to innovation that focuses more on digital insights and scaling meaningful interactions across the organization to make more room for the offline, one-on-one relationships that leaders, employees and customers crave.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>In 2021, expect more focus on operationalizing distributed work, with a particular emphasis on workplace analytics, collaboration and other tools that can help leaders better connect digital and physical sources of information.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<h2>4. New models for customer relationships<\/h2>\n\n<p>One common refrain from leaders was that they are spending more time talking to customers than ever before, and about a broader range of topics. Beyond products or services, customers are interested in how to increase their ability to work digitally, and in a distributed environment, how to plan for future disruptions, and, more than anything, to share observations with people who are experiencing similar issues in their own business. Leaders also shared examples of changing or developing new offers, implementing COVID-19 resource portals and offering a broader range of help and guidance on industry and business issues overall.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>In 2021, expect more focus on relationships and offer innovation&mdash;finding ways to enrich relationships with customers to drive preference and value over time. More than anything, expect that the most successful customer relationships will become less transactional, more interactional, and an even greater driver of competitive advantage.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<h2>5. There has never been a better time for business model innovation<\/h2>\n\n<p>The abrupt shift to cloud computing, and the acceleration of digital transformation efforts, was unlike anything leaders had ever seen. Executives who resisted digital tools found themselves converted, while processes that had thus far resisted digitalization became digitized virtually overnight. Granted, much of this was a question of business continuity and survival, rather than considered strategy, and there is far more work to be done, but the opportunities are beginning emerge.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>As vaccines begin to roll out and we enter a new and more promising year, leaders will more fully assess the opportunities presented by cloud computing, artificial intelligence, sensors and 3-D visualization to bring insight, depth and intelligence to processes, products and services. They will focus on building ecosystems, unlocking the value of converged and networked industries, and use the hard-won insights from the past year to position their businesses for innovation and growth.<\/em><\/p>"},

It&rsquo;s clear that on sustainability, APAC&rsquo;s business and government leaders need to accelerate. The question is, &lsquo;how?&rsquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Finding the Fast Lane to Progress&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>To reach the 2030 objectives, the likely consequence is a carrot-and-stick of new incentives and regulations. But the real advances will be made by business leaders who embrace a combination of technology and re-engineered operating models. After all, investors are already monitoring ESG policies closely. When the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.in\/customer-stories\/bial-video\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">Bangalore International Airport<\/a>&nbsp;team leveraged digital tools to achieve sustainability goals while completing their new Terminal 2, it was a request from investors rather than policymakers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean the logjam isn&rsquo;t also breaking on the policy front. In January 2021, Indonesia announced its first-ever&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wri.org\/outcomes\/indonesia-adopts-its-first-ever-sustainable-development-plan\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">sustainable development plan<\/a>, with hard targets for reducing greenhouse gases. Shortly after, Singapore launched its&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.greenplan.gov.sg\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">Green Plan 2030<\/a>: a government-wide program of legislation and subsidy involving ministries from education to trade, transportation, and the environment.<\/p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/sustainability\/26-takeaways-from-cop26-what-leaders-should-know\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">COP26<\/a>, China announced a new deal with the US to tackle emissions; India promised to generate half of its electricity from renewables by 2030; and Japan pledged an extra $10 billion in overseas climate financing, on top of the $60 billion already committed to supporting the decarbonization of Asia and beyond.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>More countries and companies are making new climate pledges to reduce waste and energy usage as well as cut greenhouse gas emissions. But since financing and implementing new technologies takes time, it&rsquo;s in the adoption of solutions to deliver on those promises where friction is likely.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In the energy sector, McKinsey found that the average utility company could save up to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/sustainability\/our-insights\/the-challenge-of-climate-change\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">billion dollars<\/a>&nbsp;over 20 years by rolling out readily-available digital solutions that ease the transition to renewables.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Embracing microgrids and battery storage adds resilience and adaptability to utility operating models. Yet most companies still rely on carbon-intensive energy sources, reactive management, and traditional capacity planning tools.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s just one example from one sector. Across APAC, business leaders should consider their approach to technology and sustainability. There are concrete steps they can take now to harness current technologies and deliver sustainable profitability.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Capabilities Are Already Available&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>One of the most potent lessons from the pandemic is how quickly digital adoption can transform entire industries. The solution doesn&rsquo;t even have to be new. The X factor lies in how widely it&#39;s adopted inside an organization and to what extent traditional processes are improved, automated&mdash;or replaced with something better.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Technologies with the power to deliver sustainable outcomes like Internet of Things (IoT), analytics, and machine learning are at the early adoption phase and beginning to find a place in Asia-Pacific business models.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In the AEC sector, for example, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is gaining traction in the design and project management of infrastructure and large construction projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The built environment is responsible for around&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/recent-content\/how-leaders-can-fight-climate-change-in-construction-2\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">40%<\/a>&nbsp;of carbon emissions worldwide, while a typical construction site discards&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/topics\/earth-and-planetary-sciences\/construction-waste\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">as much as 30%<\/a>&nbsp;of the construction material it sources. By using BIM technologies to manage project development, waste can be reduced by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com\/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mdpi.com%2F2071-1050%2F13%2F15%2F8427%2Fhtm&amp;data=03%7C01%7C%7Cf97790cc2c914e9ea47213e0471886f9%7C67bff79e7f914433a8e5c9252d2ddc1d%7C0%7C0%7C637744898553816443%7CGood%7CV0FDfHsiViI6IjAuMC4wMDAwIiwiUCI6IiIsIkFOIjoiIiwiV1QiOjR9&amp;sdata=lH4jCjJjnuD0zxXkkr31M3Ip6VyGpGvF2GomO3VtArA%3D&amp;reserved=0\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">15%<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>And these technologies can also be used to improve operations after a facility has opened its doors. They can optimize the monitoring and management of building energy performance, helping align power consumption with actual need.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Michael Long, head of sustainability, Asia at Lendlease, wrote in June 2021 that while APAC&rsquo;s construction industry is moving towards digitalization, &ldquo;developers should look at utilizing digital twin technology as an intelligence interface for autonomous adaptive control.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The future, he says, lies in buildings that use digital technologies to operate sustainably and autonomously: &ldquo;they represent an evolution from static physical spaces to self-aware environments that can anticipate and adapt to human needs.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>BIM use cases and success stories aren&rsquo;t difficult to find, yet just&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/constructionblog.autodesk.com\/asia-pacific-construction-firms\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">7%<\/a>&nbsp;of APAC construction companies say they use the technology to its full potential. That suggests a lot of room for broader adoption. Investments in early-stage innovation could lead the AEC industry toward building more high-quality residential buildings&mdash;with less negative impact on people and the planet.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Expanding the use of digital could also lead to a common industry data platform and make progress towards sustainability objectives easier to track.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>&ldquo;Sustainovation&rdquo;<\/h2>\n\n<p>One great example of technologies&rsquo; ability to drive sustainable outcomes is Bangkok&rsquo;s<a href=\"http:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/customer-stories\/mqdc\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">&nbsp;WHIZDOM 101<\/a>&nbsp;complex. It&rsquo;s a sustainable smart city built inside a large metropolis, designed from the ground up to help residents lead greener, healthier, and more fulfilling lives.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The project&rsquo;s ingenious use of digital unifies technology and community. Energy- and data-collecting floor tiles at the campus entrance convert kinetic energy from human footsteps into low-voltage electricity, which can be stored and used to power LED lighting, wayfinding solutions, and mobile device chargers. When visitors arrive at the site, they create renewable energy by simply strolling across the threshold.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The buildings that make up the site also use fewer components and are made with eco-friendly materials and methods. The project&rsquo;s central tower, for example, is positioned to allow for better natural airflow and maximum sunlight. By drawing in natural light and wind, residents use less energy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>When the complex opens its doors, the 3D model will be handed over to property managers, who will have a &lsquo;digital twin&rsquo; they can use to monitor and manage the site.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>On the manufacturing side, Bangalore-based&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.greendzine.in\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">Greendzine<\/a>&nbsp;is using digital design to create low-speed electric vehicles faster and more sustainably than competitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Cloud collaboration and design tools have enabled the startup to adopt a modular R&amp;D approach. It means they can extend product lines using standard components that amount to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/low-speed-electric-vehicle\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">70% of the bill<\/a>&nbsp;for parts and materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>This saves time in testing and validating&mdash;even at low production volumes. Designers and product managers are also in a better position to work collaboratively from a single &#39;source of truth,&#39; and get from prototype to production faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like creating in virtual clay,&rdquo; says Karthikeyan Sundaram, cofounder and chief technology officer at Greendzine. &ldquo;Digital helps us move to a physical prototype quickly. Because it&rsquo;s been 3D rendered, we know immediately whether it fits the requirement or not. That&rsquo;s how we fail fast and move forward.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>What Is the World Waiting For?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth pondering just how long science has been aware that industrialization and economic progress had a potential flip side.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>French mathematician Joseph Fourier proposed the existence of an atmospheric &lsquo;greenhouse effect&rsquo; in the 1820s.&nbsp; Russian geologist Vladimir Vernadsky detailed the interdependence between human life and the earth&#39;s ecological systems in his 1926 book&nbsp;<em>The Biosphere<\/em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>A century or two later, we&rsquo;re fully awake to how fragile those connections are. Science can reveal a lot. While technology can help provide the enabling framework for reaching sustainability goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Consider the example of South Korea. Its Green Growth strategy provided government support for battery storage R&amp;D that enabled breakthroughs in stable multicycle charging and early support for integrated battery deployment. Lithium-ion battery costs declined&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/about.bnef.com\/blog\/battery-pack-prices-cited-below-100-kwh-for-the-first-time-in-2020-while-market-average-sits-at-137-kwh\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">nearly 90%<\/a>&nbsp;from 2010 to 2020, and by 2013, South Korean battery producers had captured a leading market share.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>After months when rapid climate change wreaked havoc around the world, APAC business leaders have proven they can play a leading role in addressing the urgency of the situation. Customers and stakeholders want to align themselves with businesses willing to take action. The decisions we make now can help secure a resilient and sustainable future.&nbsp;<\/p>"},

But what does it mean exactly and how can it help to grow your business?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Digital transformation is becoming a key factor in determining future business success, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This is partly due to the growing demand for customized design, and partly due to the ever-increasing pace at which competitors in the domestic and export markets are able to innovate.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Even so, many enterprises are still struggling to implement appropriate strategies that would strike the right balance between day-to-day business requirements and structural realignment.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;When I talk to CEOs and business owners about digital transformation, I find that many of them want a turnkey solution and rarely question how it is actually supposed to work,&rdquo; says Karl Osti, Senior Industry Manager Manufacturing at Autodesk. He emphasizes that digital transformation is a step-by-step process that needs to be initiated carefully.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Sven Dickmans, Senior Technical Sales Specialist at Autodesk, agrees. &ldquo;Going from zero to 100 in terms of digitalization would lead to a standstill at most companies,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also important to consider and include the employees throughout the process.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h2>How to Get Started<\/h2>\n\n<p>The first step toward digitalization involves a comprehensive product lifecycle management (PLM) strategy. This will help maximize the efficiency of operational processes with a roadmap that covers everything from manufacturing to sales.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>A good PLM strategy will start by scrutinizing any sub-processes, like preparing a quote. Next, it will help determine which work processes are necessary, how are they are organized, what employees and departments are involved, and what feedback or control loops need to be considered throughout the digitalization process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Many processes or milestones won&rsquo;t even have been identified and first need to be clearly defined so that everyone involved knows what we&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; says Dickmans. He also advocates digitalizing a small area first. This allows employees to quickly familiarize themselves with the new system and accelerates testing, which saves time-consuming corrections later on.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Benefits of Digitalization<\/h2>\n\n<h3><strong style=\"font-weight:700\">1.&nbsp;Faster Development Cycles, More Sales<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>In sales, the adoption of agile product scenarios opens up new ways to acquire more contracts. Examples include faster production cycles and customized product models that are still cost-effective, thanks to modularized manufacturing techniques.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Added-value services offered as part of after-sales services are becoming increasingly important. Osti explains that companies are able to sell a whole range of additional services, including digital twins, remote maintenance, and a digital spare parts catalog, in addition to the physical product. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not only increasing the overall benefits the product brings to the customer,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m also reducing my own costs.&rdquo; One example he provides is remote maintenance, which reduces the need for service technicians to travel to plants.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong style=\"font-weight:700\">2.&nbsp;Improved Innovation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>The benefits associated with digital transformation extend far beyond the immediate operational processes. There are also important strategic advantages to digitalization that encourage company-wide innovation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In many cases, restructuring production and supply chains will reveal an incredible potential for innovation. Restructuring by integrating&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/what-is-generative-design-2\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">generative design<\/a>, for instance, will allow for faster, more efficient development of new components by combining artificial intelligence with design simulation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lennard Schulenburg, Managing Director of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/industrial-x-ray-machine\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">VisiConsult X-ray Systems &amp; Solutions GmbH<\/a>, sees the automation of internal processes as another way to use digital transformation to foster innovation. His company, which specializes in manufacturing systems for the non-destructive testing of materials and components for customers in the automotive, aerospace, and oil and gas industries, is currently working on practical implementations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The way we currently manage innovation is still quite unstructured,&rdquo; says Schulenburg. But he believes this is going to change in the near future, as his company&rsquo;s PLM strategy can support a more structured approach. &ldquo;A digitalized innovation funnel will allow employees to submit their proposals for improvement via a corresponding interface,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;These are then reviewed by the R&amp;D department and go into a pipeline.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong style=\"font-weight:700\">3.&nbsp;New Business Areas and Increased Productivity<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Digital transformation often leads to significant increases in productivity. Increasing productivity ultimately improves profitability, which stabilizes the company&rsquo;s financial foundation. This improves the balance sheet and frees up funding for both business development and R&amp;D.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The company&rsquo;s market position is also strengthened by its reputation for having a long-term commitment to the principles of digital transformation. The company&rsquo;s own competitive position improves thanks to sophisticated order, production, and logistics processes, as well as value-added services in the after-sales area, turning digital transformation into a real competitive advantage for SMEs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Extending the value chain also generates new revenue and sales opportunities. Companies that offer new services and products as a result of digital transformation are able to expand their portfolio and benefit from closing market gaps.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Implementing Digitalization With Change Management&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/image-src.bcg.com\/Images\/BCG-Industrial-Products-Makers-Chart-a-New-Path-to-Digital-Apr-2020_tcm9-246646.pdf\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">2020 study<\/a>&nbsp;by the Boston Consulting Group found that while services generate just 30% of sales, they account for 40% of the gross profit margin for the manufacturers surveyed. The service sector is growing at a rate of almost 30% above that of other business sectors.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>VisiConsult is also focusing on offering services to generate additional growth. &ldquo;In the past, we thought in terms of orders or projects and perhaps ended up finalizing a maintenance contract with the client,&rdquo; says Schulenburg. &ldquo;Our primary focus is now recurring revenues from services such as warranty extensions, spare parts guarantees, and even value-added services such as AI-based evaluation algorithms for our systems.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Schulenburg explains that the equipment his company sells serves as a vehicle to realize these additional services. &ldquo;I can only encourage every heavy equipment manufacturer to break down their business into one-off sales and recurring sales, and take a close look at the resulting figures,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Osti advises SMEs to sustainably implement their digital transformation strategy using&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.de\/change-management\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">change management<\/a>&nbsp;to ensure the successful completion of this process. &ldquo;As an SME, it&rsquo;s important to set small-step goals and drive the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/digital-transformation-road-map\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">digital transformation<\/a>&nbsp;forward at a gradual but consistent pace,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But you should always be aware that you can&rsquo;t make the step from sheet metal processor to high-tech company overnight.&rdquo; Osti believes that SMEs should start their transformation journey by clearly defining their objectives. This requires long-term commitment, but it pays off in the end.<\/p>\n"},

They looked at a range of issues, from the pandemic to the social, geographic, and demographic changes that affect the industry and the way we work. Here are three key lessons from the discussion.<\/p>\n\n<h2>1. How Businesses Plan: From Monolithic Planning to Adaptive Systems Thinking<\/h2>\n\n<p>The combination of maturing technologies, converging industries, and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a spectrum of risks driven by consolidation, a changing market landscape, and overhead and capitalization costs, but it also illuminates opportunities for improving the agility of the industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re really talking about,&rdquo; says Paul Murphy, Information Services Leader, Asia Pacific at GHD, a global professional services firm focused on the engineering, construction and architecture industries, &ldquo;is bringing an adaptive systems thinking view to community infrastructure and finding ways to go from monolithic, long-term investment and planning cycles into shorter timelines of agile and adaptable planning and delivery cycles.&rdquo; Scenario planning, agile methodologies, collaboration and intelligent technologies all have a role to play in designing organizations that are able to adapt to&mdash;and anticipate&mdash;changes to the business environment.<\/p>\n\n<h2>2. How Businesses Organize: From Silos to Common Objectives and Understanding<\/h2>\n\n<p>Given the number of geographies and disciplines that AEC comprises, there are differing opinions on the type of organizational changes needed to enable resilience and innovation. Some leaders expressed that they expected to see flatter organizations in response to distributed work while others disagreed.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;At the end of the day, culture trumps intent,&rdquo; said Chris Luebkeman, Head of Strategic Foresight, Office of the President, ETH University, Zurich. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree that we&rsquo;ll only see a steady flattening of organizations; most of us need clear lines of responsibility and accountability. Hierarchy is one way to express this, and this is welcome in some cultures and challenges others. Time will tell which will triumph.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>While organizational structures will always vary based on industry, geography, culture, and other factors, the past year has further exposed critical differences in the ways different teams and disciplines think, work, and even evaluate success. Some of these process and language differences are innate to certain disciplines (design and engineering, for example), but moving to more agile ways of working will accelerate the need for better translation and communication among groups.<\/p>\n\n<h2>3. How and What Businesses Build: From Artifact to Product<\/h2>\n\n<p>Digitalization, distributed work, financial and societal shifts are forcing AEC leaders to reconsider long-held assumptions about what and how to build. Innovations such as sensors, robotics, machine learning, and predictive analytics can enable built environments to sense, predict, and even self-repair essential functions, but these capabilities are critical not only to the finished product&mdash;a building, a power plant, or a bridge, for example&mdash;but to the project delivery process itself.<\/p>\n\n<p>Says Cory Dippold, Vice President and Head of Strategic Project Applications at Mott MacDonald, a global management, engineering and development consultancy: &ldquo;Project delivery is equal parts planned activities and a bunch of gotchas&mdash;change of conditions, change of scope, change of people, change of economic factors&mdash;stuff that is hard to see coming that you may not have thought about until it&rsquo;s sitting in your lap. And I think there&rsquo;s a real opportunity to address that by using better project performance data.&rdquo; To do this requires a combination of stakeholder integration, common protocols, language and data, and the technology and tools needed to enable these capabilities.<\/p>\n\n<p>Beyond the tools, however, leaders discussed the mindset changes needed to lead AEC into the future. One participant commented that &ldquo;the industry talks about disruption and innovation, but we seem to be stuck in a place where innovation means using different technology but asking for the same output.&rdquo; Adopting&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/productization-strategy\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">productization strategies<\/a>, in which the industry approaches building with more of a product development mindset, can bring more predictability, efficiency, and insight to construction while helping to promote sustainability goals as well. Said one symposium participant, &ldquo;The industry absolutely needs to embrace industrialized methods like design for manufacture and assembly (DfMA) and prefabrication but keep the sense of designing for human value.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to business concerns, participants also discussed societal and sustainability impacts as well. Asked one leader, &ldquo;What would it look like to focus less on profit and more on prosperity? How could we articulate the value of prosperity in a compelling and consistent way? What metrics might we need?&rdquo; Others focused on sustainability, both from an environmental and a business perspective. &ldquo;I see environmentalism and resilience as interrelated,&rdquo; said another executive. &ldquo;The world is changing, and our building and infrastructure are going to respond by being stronger and more sustainable.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>More than anything else, however, AEC leaders around the world share a sense of urgency and commitment to using crisis as an opportunity for change and growth. Said Sabine Oberhuber, Co-Founder of Turntoo, a Dutch management consulting firm focused on the circular economy, &ldquo;This whole time is disruptive&mdash;the economy, politics, society, the state of the planet&mdash;we have an opportunity to reinvent the system.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p><em>For more insights from Autodesk&rsquo;s AEC Futures Symposium, read the report&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/research-reports\/reimagining-aec-industry-leaders-look-to-a-post-covid-future\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Reimagining AEC: Leaders Look to a Post COVID-19 Future<\/em><\/a><\/p>"},

Across industries, those points of convergence can be stepping stones to new business opportunities.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>As average temperatures continue to rise and the global population shifts and urbanizes, megatrends are ripping up old ways of operating. Demand for&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.themanufacturer.com\/articles\/digital-transformation-enables-greater-sustainability\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">greater sustainability<\/a>&nbsp;is on the increase, with both energy and resource-intensive industries under intensifying scrutiny.<\/p>\n\n<p>To understand where those sectors are on the road to net zero, Autodesk partnered with global research firm Frost &amp; Sullivan to survey 600 architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) and manufacturing executives in leading European markets. How are they going to deliver business results alongside&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/sustainability\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">sustainable<\/a>&nbsp;outcomes? Here&rsquo;s what the research uncovered.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Regional Insights, Global Relevance<\/h2>\n\n<p>Four out of five companies now have a formal sustainability team in place, typically with a wide-ranging remit and lines of reporting that reach straight into the boardroom. That signifies that green objectives have moved beyond CSR to become an operational norm, part of a new decision-making process that reflects the cross-functional and collaborative requirements of achieving net-zero.<\/p>\n\n<p>The majority of leaders surveyed believe that to maintain a competitive advantage and retain customers, companies must embrace sustainability. This is a major cultural shift as companies chart new ways to differentiate by demonstrating environmental leadership.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>As a result, many firms are going beyond industry standards to strengthen their sustainability credentials&mdash;and even looking outside industry silos to fashion cross-sector models of circularity.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Here&rsquo;s One Example&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Global steelmaker&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.arcelormittal.com\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">ArcelorMittal<\/a>&nbsp;is moving away from its traditional reliance on fossil fuels and testing new energy sources like biomass. The process of reducing iron ore inevitably requires a lot of heat, but it can be generated using discarded wood from the construction industry, as a facility in Belgium is doing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The waste gases from the blast furnace are then captured and converted into ethanol and methanol, which can then be used to create other products that would have been made from carbon-intensive sources in the past.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Once you establish a pattern of circularity, the environmental benefits keep multiplying,&rdquo; said Annie Heaton, ArcelorMittal&rsquo;s head of sustainability, in a recent webinar. During that event, Heaton discussed the implications of Frost &amp; Sullivan&#39;s findings, and she raised the possibility of large manufacturing businesses becoming carbon negative: &ldquo;If we use a biomass input and then bury the CO2 using a system like BCCS (biomass and CCS) for carbon capture, we can turn heavy industry into a carbon sink.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzJlNDIxNDhlODQxLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTg2YjkwZTI4OWU4NWY3ZDkzNDRlOGY4ZGZjYzQ1YjQz\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h2>Six Key Takeaways From the Research<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTExODY4MiZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MTA3ZTEwM2RlYjRlLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTE3YTAxNWI5MTUzYWU3MTRmN2QzMGQyMTk2Y2FhYmY4\" \/><\/h2>\n\n<h3>1. Digitalization is enabling sustainable decisions.<\/h3>\n\n<p>With access to a vast amount of data and more granular analytics, sustainable outcomes are becoming part of everything designed and made. Supply chain sustainability is growing in importance and increasingly supported by product passports, track-and-trace solutions, cutting-edge sustainability rating, labeling, or certification.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Giving customers better information and the tools for data-driven decision-making empowers them to make informed choices about sustainable materials and metrics.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTExODY4MiZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MTA3ZTExYjg1OGM5LnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWNiNGMyNmE5ZTk2YjYzZjkwYTAzNWEyOGQ2Y2FjZWJm\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h3>2. The UN&#39;s Sustainability Development Goals are reshaping how business is conducted.<\/h3>\n\n<p>Sustainability objectives are shaping how buildings and products are designed, created&mdash;and in the case of buildings&mdash;managed across a lifecycle. Circularity is fully on the agenda now, meaning disassembly and reuse of materials are actively planned for.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The UN&#39;s 17 Sustainability Development Goals (<a href=\"https:\/\/sdgs.un.org\/goals\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">SDGs<\/a>) and the accompanying circular economy business model have become vital guides as a result.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTExODY4MiZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MTA3ZTEyZTI3MjM2LnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTI4MzI5NTQ5NGFkMmI1NThlODQ3YmQwMzQyNTYwMDg1\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h3>3. Convergence across industries is happening.<\/h3>\n\n<p>Manufacturing, architecture, design, and construction are all learning mutual lessons, particularly in areas like supply-chain data sharing, modular factories, and the increasing prefabrication of construction components.&nbsp; Sharing best practices across sectors is accelerating opportunities to reduce the carbon footprint of everything people are designing and making.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTExODY4MiZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MTA3ZTE0MTgyYTdkLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWVmYWNmNWQwMTYzNmIwZjYzOWI3NjJkZTI3ODJmMzYz\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h3>4. Stakeholder capitalism is on the rise.<\/h3>\n\n<p>The idea that businesses have to address the needs and desires of multiple stakeholders&mdash;from employees to customers to communities, as well as investors&mdash;has finally taken hold.&nbsp; As more and more stakeholders become involved in business decision-making, it&#39;s driving the movement toward more sustainable future operations.&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTExODY4MiZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MTA3ZTE1MmM2MTU2LnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWY0ZDNjNWM5YTVmODg0NTc5MzllZmM3YzhlYzUxYzVh\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h3>5. Today&rsquo;s world is hyperconnected.<\/h3>\n\n<p>If the past year has taught people anything, it&rsquo;s how easily connections can be shattered and reshaped. Today, people have better tools to analyze and navigate the complex environments they live and work in. They help people make better decisions about energy consumption, responsible sourcing, and the industrial processes that will guarantee a more resilient future.&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTExODY4MiZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MTA4NDQ3YjFkNTAwLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWRiMDc2NzkzN2MyN2YyMTdjYWVjMWRiMWQ2OWI5NjM0\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h3>6. Sustainability has become a business fundamental.<\/h3>\n\n<p>Sustainability is becoming central to business operations&sbquo; arguably as important as people, raw materials, and credit lines. If that sounds like an exaggeration, consider how corporate finance is reorganizing for a bigger role in hitting net-zero objectives. The EU has now completed its&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/business-economy-euro\/banking-and-finance\/sustainable-finance\/eu-taxonomy-sustainable-activities_en\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">Taxonomy for sustainable activities<\/a><\/em>, a vital ingredient of the broader plan for financing sustainable growth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&#39;s going to be the guideline for every financial institution when they&rsquo;re deciding where they&rsquo;re going to put their money,&rdquo; said SWECO&rsquo;s Mattias Goldman, chief sustainability officer at SWECO. Speaking in the recent webinar, he shared that financiers in Europe, America, and ASEAN are joining policymakers to decide how financial instruments can be used to combat climate change.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Every company, he said, is going to have to raise its game as a result: &ldquo;With the European Green Deal and the &lsquo;build back better&rsquo; movement in the US, it&rsquo;s becoming clear that if you only pursue mediocre initiatives for climate and sustainability, you&#39;re going to have to pay for them yourself. If you do something top-notch, there is a great opportunity to have a large part of the bill paid by somebody else.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Sustainability and Opportunity<\/h2>\n\n<p>Today&rsquo;s economy is increasingly interconnected, and many are learning that it is more fragile than anyone ever realized. The pandemic may turn out to be the reset button for a green recovery and an opportunity to focus on achieving the UN&rsquo;s SDGs, but only if a circular economy business model supports those objectives.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Sustainability offers businesses greater resilience while the digital initiatives required to achieve it open up new opportunities for growth. Tomorrow&rsquo;s FTSE 100 may well comprise companies that were first to reengineer their supply chains and production processes to create a closed-loop of inputs and outputs.<\/p>\n\n<p>At Autodesk,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/adsknews.autodesk.com\/views\/2020-impact-report-ceo\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">we&#39;re doing our bit<\/a>&mdash;pursuing ambitious sustainability objectives in our own business operations and supply chain while remaining focused on enhancing the tools and capabilities that will help the industries we serve progress on the path to sustainability and greater digital efficiency.<\/p>\n"},

The pandemic forced companies to adopt new processes and new tools. The changes promise to take the profession back to a previous gilded age.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>As COVID-19 restrictions begin to ease, APAC&#39;s architecture firms are coming to terms with their own version of the new normal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The last two years have been marked by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/monograph.com\/blog\/architecture-industry-statistics-and-trends\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">project delays<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.aia.org\/pages\/6366635-abi-december-2020-architecture-firm-billin\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">reduced billings<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.architecture.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/Measuring-the-impact-of-the-pandemic-report_2020_Australian-Institure-of-Architects.pdf\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">workforce realignments<\/a>, and rejigging operations to reduce overheads. Amid so much change and the risk of new disruptions, firms across the region have had to think hard about how they continue to deliver value to clients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;Clients are asking for more assurance that things are being done correctly,&rdquo; says Kate Frear, director at architecture firm&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.woodsbagot.com\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">Woods Bagot<\/a>. &ldquo;As architects, there&#39;s more onus on us to demonstrate that compliance is being managed well. There&rsquo;s also been a sway towards understanding the full lifecycle of buildings and how that will impact the client&rsquo;s business requirements, whether they&rsquo;re holding assets or looking to get rid of assets.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Disruption can be painful, but it can also spark intense periods of innovation. The 2007-2008 financial crisis allowed the nascent fintech industry to shine and helped kick off the gig economy. Both trends were backed by new cloud platforms and better mobile apps.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Some of the pandemic&rsquo;s highest-profile tech stories have been the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-56247489\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">rise of video conferencing<\/a>&nbsp;and the mass shift to e-commerce. In architecture, it&#39;s been the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.architecture.com.au\/archives\/news_media_articles\/architectures-digital-evolution-client-interest-in-new-tools-exceeds-expectations\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">growing adoption<\/a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/industry\/aec\/bim\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">building information modeling<\/a>&nbsp;(BIM).&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In a time of remote working and virtual teams that collaborate across geographies, BIM has enabled APAC&rsquo;s architecture firms and clients to stay aligned on design and keep projects moving forward.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Not that everything&rsquo;s changed. &ldquo;The main work is still the design of physical space and addressing how spaces will be used,&rdquo; said Tetsu Yoshida of Japanese architectural, planning and engineering firm&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nikken.co.jp\/en\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">Nikken Sekkei<\/a>. &ldquo;What&#39;s needed now is multifaceted information processing that includes not only authoring but also project management from design to completion. We also need tools that help us design for added value during the building&#39;s operation.&quot;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmFhNzJhYTFlNGIyLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTk0ZWQwZGJkYzlkZThjNjVmNmYzZWIxMmVkZWU0OWFk\" style=\"height:333px; width:700px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h2>What Is BIM?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>BIM enables the creation of finely detailed 3D digital models of buildings. Architects use them to share an accurate representation of what the final structure will look like, inside and out, with clients and contractors.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>A 3D BIM model can integrate data sources outside of design and allow architects to conduct energy, light, materials, and cost analyses that help owners understand how a building will operate once it&rsquo;s complete.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>But it does more than give a glimpse of a building&rsquo;s physical features. BIM platforms are a single source of truth for every project stakeholder. From architects to clients, contractors, engineers, and inspectors, BIM offers a shared knowledge resource where ideas are stored, and complex calculations can happen quickly whenever something changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>This has helped APAC architects update their workflows in response to pandemic restrictions and continue designing high-performance buildings that are cost-efficient, sustainable, and visually striking.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Major architecture and engineering businesses like ours are shifting to digitization to improve coordination on design, structural elements, equipment, and materials utilization among project partners,&rdquo; said Nikken Sekkei&rsquo;s Yoshida.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>He says that more firms are now using BIM to link design documents and data, making the complex calculations and recalculations that happen during construction easier to execute quickly. Past and present project data is being migrated to cloud-based systems to create repositories of intelligence that can be used for analytics, inform the creation of new 3D models for future designs, and create better digital twins.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Those capabilities are game-changers that potentially redefine architecture&rsquo;s place in the construction process. The profession may find itself once again at the center of new projects, playing a leading role from start to finish, and beyond.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Back to the Future&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>In days of yore, architects were &lsquo;master builders&rsquo;, overseeing the process end-to-end from concept to completion. Over time, their function evolved into something more specialized. Architects naturally fulfill the designer&#39;s role, but once plans were handed off to contractors, they had limited responsibility for the outcome of the finished product.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Kate Frear says APAC firms are now seeing a shift&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.architecturalrecord.com\/articles\/6719-the-new-master-builders\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">back to a more elevated role<\/a>. BIM&#39;s capabilities have moved more of the design and build process to the front end, with architects doing more to identify potential risks and deficiencies before construction starts, collaborating more closely through the build with contractors and engineers, and looking ahead to how a building will be managed and operated after it opens its doors.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;The procurement model is starting to change,&rdquo; says Frear. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a swing underway, moving us back to a more traditional role for architects. Some building deficiencies in Australia have called into question what the role of the architect is, what the role of the builder is, and what the role of the client is. That&#39;s made it critical to ensure that risks are placed in the right buckets and that we&rsquo;re clear about who&#39;s taking the risk. That&#39;s changing how we interact with both clients and contractors, and the emphasis on deliverables like 3D models and the information used to create them.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Clients Are Seeing Digital&rsquo;s Upside&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Digital will continue to be an enabler as architecture responds to shifting client demands. A recent survey by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.architecture.com.au\/archives\/news_media_articles\/architectures-digital-evolution-client-interest-in-new-tools-exceeds-expectations\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">Australian Institute of Architects<\/a>&nbsp;(AIA) points to augmented reality as the next big source of pipeline opportunities, with 17% of respondents saying their firms were currently generating revenue from AR services.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, clients also seem to have caught the BIM bug. Close to half of clients surveyed by the AIA said they are eager to learn more about BIM and its applications.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>APAC&rsquo;s architectural firms should &ldquo;embrace the potential of emerging technologies by deeply entwining it into their business models,&rdquo; said AIA president Tony Giannone in a statement accompanying the research.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Woods Bagot&rsquo;s Kate Frear says doing that is already helping firms like Woods Bagot work closer with clients and help them achieve more holistic objectives.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;It does change how we consider the project. We can model things like the efficiency of claddings, look at building services, and more. When clients are prepared to undergo that design process, what you get is a much more resilient outcome.&quot;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>However, BIM is still an evolving technology, and there is scope for improvements to make it more accessible for clients and partners.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;To better meet client requirements, it&rsquo;s necessary to have a common language to improve communication between the parties. The key to this is a BIM data viewer that anyone can use easily, just like PDF,.&rdquo; says Nikken Sekkei&rsquo;s Yoshida. &ldquo;If we can securely pull data that fits the workflow from the environment like CDE, where BIM and text data is unified, each project stakeholder will be able to use the data more effectively.&quot;&nbsp;<\/p>"},

With software already reprogramming the automotive sector from design to manufacturing, the question might already be answered.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The auto industry is in a state of extreme flux, with every link in the value chain being transformed by a powerful set of disruptors, all converging to create an entirely new mobility ecosystem.<\/p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a big statement, but the evidence is undeniable. Today&rsquo;s carmakers face a not-so-distant future that&#39;s being hammered into shape by mega-trends like electrification, digitization,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/sustainability\/our-insights\/the-zero-carbon-car-abating-material-emissions-is-next-on-the-agenda?cid=eml-web\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">sustainability<\/a>&nbsp;and emission standards, connectivity, VR, and AI.<\/p>\n\n<p>Together, they&rsquo;re setting the stage for immense innovation that could bring huge growth to an industry that already provides direct and indirect jobs to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/growth\/sectors\/automotive_en\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">13.8 million<\/a>&nbsp;Europeans.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Assembly Lines of Code<\/h2>\n\n<p>Underpinning everything is the embrace of technology that makes vehicles - and the processes that create them &ndash; far more responsive to changing consumer and industrial use cases.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the digital age, drivers and passengers expect the same degree of connectivity from vehicles as they do from their homes and offices. Smartphones, laptops, tablets, wearables and onboard systems should all link up seamlessly. That includes everything from infotainment to assisted driving and smart parking, where payment options are accessible from a touch-screen dashboard.<\/p>\n\n<p>What does that mean for manufacturing processes? In the future, a digital component will likely need to be added to everything an automaker produces, enabling automotive industry leaders to build better car designs catered to the needs of specific driver personas.<\/p>\n\n<p>Designers and engineers will need to gather data using new VR design tools that blend immersive visualization with haptic feedback, allowing them to feel exactly how comfortably their designs will play out in real life.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Virtually by Hand<\/h2>\n\n<p>Speaking at Autodesk&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/campaigns\/aif\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">Automotive Innovation Forum<\/a>&nbsp;in April, Nissan Senior VP and Head of Design, Alfonso Albaisa, said the company is already using advanced design tools to &lsquo;humanize virtual experiences.&rsquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Under COVID restrictions, he and his global design team have been able to meet in virtual studios to collaborate on new car models, their avatars moving from vehicle to vehicle, sitting behind steering wheels and manually manipulating rear-view mirrors, altering components, or suggesting alterations.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;As designers, we want to get inside new designs and experience them as soon as we can. These design tools create an environment where more natural and spontaneous communication can happen, which is vital for the creative process.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>This new level of digital capability needs different skillsets, from engineering to sales and aftermarket service, up in the design studio and down on the factory floor.<\/p>\n\n<p>As technology tightens its grip on the industry, it&rsquo;s critical that the automotive workforce develops the right skills and has the latest digital tools. To attract and keep talent, everything needs to become digitized to reflect the needs of the more mobile, interconnected home and office environments that have come with the rise in remote work.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Automakers Need More Coders, and Cars Need More Code<\/h2>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s car infotainment systems use more than 10 million lines of code,&rdquo; said Audi&rsquo;s Member of the Board of Management for Marketing and Sales, Hildegard Wortmann, speaking at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/gtc21.event.nvidia.com\/media\/Transforming%20the%20Automotive%20Future%3A%20Innovations%20in%20Digitalization%2C%20Electrification%2C%20and%20Sustainability%20%5BE32520%5D\/1_cmpvc60g\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">NVIDIA&rsquo;s GTC21<\/a>&nbsp;event this year. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as much code as an entire vehicle needed just a few years ago.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Traditional auto manufacturing leaders are adapting to software&rsquo;s exploding prominence in different ways.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some manufacturers are partnering with established software vendors to take advantage of cross-industry expertise and apply it to their own needs for design, fabrication, and assembly. Others opt to vertically integrate, building entire divisions devoted to creating custom code suited to their cars and customers.<\/p>\n\n<p>One thing is certain: adapting in the right way is crucial.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/industries\/automotive-and-assembly\/our-insights\/when-code-is-king-mastering-automotive-software-excellence\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">McKinsey research<\/a>&nbsp;shows that top software companies report throughput and quality that is three to six times higher than that of bottom-performing competitors: &nbsp;a far bigger productivity difference than the one between hardware developers.&nbsp;That means that integrating software into a business needs to be done correctly, in order to bring huge rewards.<\/p>\n\n<p>But can an automotive business really act like a Silicon Valley unicorn? Volkswagen clearly thinks so. The company has just launched its new CARIAD software division. With plans for 10,000 employees, the unit&#39;s headcount will make it the second-largest tech company in Europe, second only to SAP.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Agile Automotive Business?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Whether automakers mimic tech companies, partner with established vendors, or build their own software, the imperatives of digital mean they&rsquo;ll have to come to terms with new notions about product lifecycles.<\/p>\n\n<p>Carmakers are used to a linear process where products are developed gradually over years before being unveiled to the public. In software, one year can represent two or more releases.<\/p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s because tech products progress under a process of continuous improvement.&nbsp; Vehicles and components need to reflect this by undergoing continuous improvement.. Otherwise, automotive manufacturers run the risk of launching vehicles that feel out of date the moment they leave the lot.<\/p>\n\n<p>All of that will have a severe impact on complexity &mdash; and cost. The driverless cars many industry watchers believe will be in mainstream use by 2030 are a case in point.<\/p>\n\n<p>Removing the need for a human driver might seem like an opportunity to simplify and optimize car designs. But the new hardware and software needed to automate the vehicles will raise the capital costs of building them.<\/p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a tech sector truism that, very often, the challenges thrown up by the application of technology are answered with calls for more technology. The automotive industry needs to act fast through digital transformation, and investments in tech must be focused on solutions that unify design, manufacturing, sourcing, sales, and service.<\/p>\n\n<p>The lessons from other sectors suggest it&rsquo;s the only way to uncover synergies and efficiencies &mdash;&nbsp;even as products and customers&rsquo; digital expectations continue to evolve.<\/p>\n"},

But what&rsquo;s determining success in either category now that yo-yoing between lockdowns and returns to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; have become a standard feature of economic life?&nbsp;<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Autodesk&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/ebooks\/building-resilient-manufacturing--aec-companies\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">commissioned&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.idc.com\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">IDC<\/a>&nbsp;to look again at the strategic drivers and underlying enablers in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) and manufacturing industries to understand the success factors behind both trajectories.&nbsp; How much has changed in nearly two years? Giulia Carosella, IDC&rsquo;s European digital transformation practice lead and principal analyst on the report, shares her perspective.&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Can you explain IDC&#39;s concept of the K-shaped recovery curve?<\/strong><br \/>After a year or more of unprecedented change, the one thing we&#39;ve learned is that the volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous business environment we all find ourselves in is here to stay. While each company has its own path to recovery, everyone will hit a fork in the road. At IDC, we call this the K-shaped recovery curve.&nbsp;<\/p><p>On the upward fork of the K, companies can accelerate their growth by laying the foundations for future success. On the downward fork, companies will face the threat of falling behind and have no choice but to fight for survival.&nbsp;<\/p><p>What will determine an organization&#39;s path on the K-shaped curve is the digital investment strategy and the extent to which it can deliver outcomes relevant to the business.&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Where do you think the AEC and manufacturing industries currently are on their digital-transformation journeys? How do they compare with other sectors?<\/strong><br \/>Manufacturing and AEC have been highly impacted by the pandemic due to business shutdowns and severe supply-chain shortages.&nbsp;<\/p><p>AEC companies have been on a faster return path to growth thanks to the release of lockdowns and national resiliency and recovery plans supporting smart buildings. Because it&#39;s more fragmented and exposed to supply-chain bottlenecks, the manufacturing industry is on a slower path.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Digitalization has accelerated in both industries, with 37% of companies in the most advanced stages of digital maturity compared to 31% in 2019. The quickening pace is driven by the need to react to changes brought about by the pandemic and the need to edge ahead of competitors.&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>You say in the report that success in the future will be measured by &ldquo;return on digital.&rdquo; How do you define it?&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>Manufacturing and AEC organizations&rsquo; investments in digital have grown massively in the past few years and have reached more than $480 billion worldwide by the end of 2021. However, most organizations are still struggling to generate value from those investments. Half have seen a less than 10% improvement in financial results or haven&rsquo;t been able to quantify the financial impact at all.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Success is linked to generating a return from digital investments, which is measured as an impact on either the top line, such as new revenue streams from digital products and services, or the bottom line from cost savings and new efficiencies.&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>You make the point that CEOs need to take direct responsibility for digital transformation. Why is that so important?<\/strong><br \/>IDC research shows that the main challenges preventing companies from generating returns from investment are not linked to the technology itself, but rather to a lack of leadership vision and support. Sometimes that manifests as a process-heavy managerial approach; in other cases, it&rsquo;s a failure to set the right KPIs or taking a siloed approach to digital budgets.&nbsp;<\/p><p>CEOs need to be on the digital front line and take direct responsibility for digital transformation, working closely with the entire C-suite to drive their digital agenda. Only if leadership truly understands the strategic role digital technologies play in moving their organizations forward can they reap the benefits of technological investment.<\/p><p><strong>What are the accelerators of digital ROI?&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>We identified five main areas that allow organizations in manufacturing and AEC to generate ROI from digital investments:<\/p><div><strong style=\"font-weight:700\">1.<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> <\/span>Optimized operations<\/strong>&nbsp;means connecting and streamlining different processes to strengthen resilience in the face of new supply-chain shocks and bottlenecks. As Michelin Chief Executive Officer Florent Menegaux said: &ldquo;We usually have one or two operational supply crises to handle at a time&mdash;right now, we have 23.&rdquo;<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div><strong style=\"font-weight:700\">2.<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> <\/span>Data-led decision making<\/strong>&nbsp;depends on managing, combining, and extracting value from vast amounts of data to enable insight-based actions. For instance,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.yamato-scientific.com\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">Yamato Scientific<\/a>, a company operating at the intersection of architecture and manufacturing, has unified data from multiple design and manufacturing systems. It optimized its workflows and won more business as a result, including a bid for one of the largest pharmaceutical-development laboratories in Japan.<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div><strong style=\"font-weight:700\">3.<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> <\/span>A people-first strategy<\/strong>&nbsp;automates repetitive and transactional processes to free people&#39;s time and enable them to innovate. During the early days of the pandemic,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/edera-safety.com\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">Edera Safety<\/a>&nbsp;had to quickly shift to a new way of working. Leveraging cloud-based collaboration tools, the team could design, prototype, and begin manufacturing a new product in just three months. Before that, it typically took them two years to take a product from concept to market.&nbsp;<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div><strong style=\"font-weight:700\">4.<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> <\/span>Innovation at scale<\/strong>, which means accelerating digital transformation to shorten the time to value. Fear of failure, a short-term focus on operations, and a lack of skills are the top three challenges limiting innovation in products, services, or business models.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stewart-Haas_Racing\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">Stewart-Haas Racing<\/a>, the title-winning NASCAR team, used generative design to produce lighter and stiffer brake pedals, achieving a 32% reduction in weight and a 50% increase in stiffness in just two months.&nbsp;<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div><strong style=\"font-weight:700\">5.<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> <\/span>Digital ecosystems<\/strong>&nbsp;enable organizations to work together with peers to deliver value, create resilience, foster innovation, and anticipate threats and opportunities. The Open Manufacturing Platform (<a href=\"https:\/\/open-manufacturing.org\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">OMP<\/a>) is an excellent example of global cooperation between businesses to accelerate innovation at scale through knowledge and data sharing and access to new technologies.<p><strong>How should digital ROI be measured?<\/strong><br \/>Every company will have to develop its own set of digital ROI metrics based on two things: the strategic digital business goals they want to achieve and the road map to getting there.<\/p><\/div><p>Some examples are an increase in existing revenue streams, the generation of new revenue streams, increased customer satisfaction, talent attraction and satisfaction, innovation rate\/number of new products and services launched, higher brand trust, and higher environmental sustainability-related performance metrics.&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Where should those at the early stages of digital transformation start?<\/strong><br \/>The first step toward understanding how to move forward is to carefully assess where your organization is today in terms of digital maturity. Benchmarking against industry peers, for example, can show you where the end goal is and enable you to identify critical steps to improvement.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Second, becoming a digitally enabled enterprise is not an overnight journey. At IDC, we treat the road map as a series of horizons, from immediate to long-term. The stages on the map are defined by use cases and are enabled by technology like intelligent buildings, augmented maintenance, and asset performance management.<\/p><p><strong>What is the one thing manufacturing and AEC companies can do to translate digital investments into business outcomes?<\/strong><br \/>Make business outcomes the starting point. The most important thing is to be clear about strategic priorities and the related business outcomes that you want to achieve. Then, you can focus on digital initiatives with a clear ROI that&rsquo;s relevant to those priorities.&nbsp;<\/p><p>This is where technology comes into play as an enabler of digital initiatives. Collaboration across the leadership team is also vital to delivering business value. With over half of all IT budgets now in the hands of the business functions, individual objectives must be viewed in the context of the organization-wide digital strategy and agenda. This often requires a culture change, which has to be driven by the C-suite, acting as what we would call a &ldquo;digital dream team.&rdquo;<\/p><p><strong>Download the full report, <em>Building Resilient Manufacturing and AEC Companies<\/em>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/ebooks\/building-resilient-manufacturing-and-aec-companies\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 112);\">here<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>"},

Here, VWT&rsquo;s Laurent Pulce talks about how the chief information officer (CIO) role has changed in his 20 years with the firm.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>You&rsquo;ve been leading VWT&rsquo;s IT function for two decades. How has the CIO role evolved in that time?<\/strong><br \/>\nI&rsquo;m going to be honest. Around 2013, I started to feel a bit bored by the CIO role. It seemed like I had done everything that could be done, and the job wasn&rsquo;t so exciting anymore. Then, in 2014, we started paying attention to the cloud and watching what companies like GE, Siemens, and Schneider Electric were doing.<\/p>\n\n<p>It required every solution provider to revisit the application landscape completely, switching from an on-premise to a pay-as-you-go model. This was a game-changer.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A lot has been written about CIOs moving up the ladder in terms of strategic importance. Is that happening at VWT?<\/strong><br \/>\nAt the beginning of my career, information technology was seen as a capex consumer and sat under the CFO&#39;s remit. But progressively, we moved more and more under operations, and now I report directly to the CEO.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>That means when I speak, it&rsquo;s not just IT&rsquo;s voice, but a voice heard by an exco member.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How does IT now contribute to revenue&mdash;how has that changed?<\/strong><br \/>\nIn the past, we had a very powerful but also a very complex on-premise system for utility clients. It could be painful to install and secure at each plant and required significant upfront expenditure.<\/p>\n\n<p>As more and more of our solution backend moved to the cloud, we were able to offer clients the same functionality, but as a pay-as-you-go service. That meant we could make our solution available on a trial basis and take advantage of flexible computing costs that were more aligned to our revenues. In other words, we were only paying for the cloud capacity we needed at any given time.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What would you say the success factors were for VWT as you made the journey to the cloud while becoming a digital solutions provider?<\/strong><br \/>\nI believe our transition was very smooth. Of course, it was important to have a road map, but overall, we had to strike a balance between moving too fast and moving too slow.<\/p>\n\n<p>In some ways, for Veolia Water Technologies, the change was drastic&mdash;we were one of the first in France to move to Google for mail, for example. But in hindsight, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s been a big success.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s not to say it was all a fairytale. There was a lot of fear initially, and people instinctively don&rsquo;t like change. With the pandemic, I think the penny finally dropped for everyone. We realized that having everything in the cloud meant working remotely would actually be a pretty simple shift.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What will the CIO role look like in a decade?<\/strong><br \/>\nI think that in the future, the CIO position, or the title as we use it now, will disappear. Ten years ago, it was powerful to be the only person in the business who understood technology. Now, more or less everyone understands, for example, what an API is, how it&rsquo;s used, and what its business value is.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In the future, it may be that we need specialists for things like cybersecurity. Still, as we collaborate more, the fences between roles like CIO, CTO and CDO are already disappearing.<\/p>"},

Data must be seen for what it is: a gold mine&nbsp;of information to help companies recover and thrive.<\/p>\n\n<p>Giulia Carosella, IDC&rsquo;s European digital transformation practice lead and principal analyst on the study, says the amount of data created during the next three years &ldquo;will be more than all the data generated in the previous 30.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a massive amount of raw material, but using it to build insights remains challenging. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear now that data is the new gold,&rdquo; she adds. &ldquo;The question is, how successfully will companies be in mining it?&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>One company that&rsquo;s found the alchemy between information and business value is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yamato-scientific.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Yamato Scientific<\/a>, a Japanese firm that operates at the intersection of AEC and manufacturing. &ldquo;They undertook a journey to unify data from multiple design and manufacturing systems in order to grow their revenues,&rdquo; Carosella says. &ldquo;As a result, the company optimized workflows and won more business, including bids for one of the largest pharmaceutical development laboratories in Japan.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmEzY2NlYTViMTIzLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPThiMTJkM2I1Y2ViODgzNGQxZDBhMTBjOGE0YmNlZTlh\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Worldwide aviation industry leader Airbus is highly dedicated to using data to design their airplane cabins of the future.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2>Using Data to Shape Product Development<\/h2>\n\n<p>Another company embracing data to drive critical business decisions is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.airbus.com\/en\" target=\"_blank\">Airbus<\/a>. Europe&rsquo;s largest aeronautics and space company uses data extensively to shape cabin product development with three dedicated data teams, each seeking different kinds of insight. Their task is to guide the future design of Airbus cabins.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;One data team is looking at the longer-term trends, conducting data analysis to better understand the driving forces behind the cabins of the future,&rdquo; says Stefan List, head of Cabin Market Insights at Airbus. &ldquo;The second conducts market research and manages surveys and market data. The third data team is dedicated to customer experience. Before implementing a new feature or cabin change, we invite airline customers to test the concepts, collect their feedback, and then gauge their reactions.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>The complexities of making changes to cabin configurations can be daunting. For instance, when considering a new overhead storage compartment design, more than 125 airline allowances for onboard luggage have to be factored in. For the last such change, List and his team conducted surveys at nine large hub airports and measured more than 3,300 pieces of luggage. Then, they spoke to nearly 2,800 passengers worldwide to understand what they brought onboard.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is just one example of how we use data in decision-making around the design of our products,&rdquo; List says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re using data to anticipate change over a 20-year timeframe. How will the passenger experience change? How will crew operations change? And how will cabins be equipped to enable a traveling experience that&rsquo;s profitable for the airline, manageable for the crews, and comfortable for passengers?&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmFjZGViYTFiODFlLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWY3ZDcwNTk0ZTI0ZWNiODIyMGI1Mjg0ZDcyM2JlNWU0\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">AEC firms are increasingly sophisticated in the ways they process data, which enables them to develop new data services for clients.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2>Building Better Relationships<\/h2>\n\n<p>Data and analytics are also helping the AEC sector keep up with increasing demands to plan across a building&rsquo;s entire lifecycle.<\/p>\n\n<p>David Thomas, chief technology officer of French engineering and construction firm Setec, says data has been steadily altering working practices since the dawn of building information modeling (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/industry\/aec\/bim\">BIM<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;At Setec, we were early believers in the power of data and computerization,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We began in the &rsquo;90s with [Autodesk] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/autocad\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">AutoCAD<\/a> and the early stages of 3D modeling, which was a major step forward.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Today, Thomas says, 3D modeling has grown in sophistication and value, with digital twins becoming established practice&mdash;a development perfectly in tune with evolving client demands.<\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve completed phase one of our digital roadmap, which was to drive adoption of leading BIM tools,&rdquo; Thomas says. &ldquo;If we go back 20 years, AutoCAD was the identical projection of what we did on the drawing board, so adoption happened quickly. As BIM grows in sophistication, adoption takes longer.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;re moving to a phase where the data in 3D models can be integrated with other data types to enable engineers to improve how they work,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;The third stage will be to apply artificial intelligence and sell new data services to clients.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Two Industries in Reset Mode<\/h2>\n\n<p>Looking across both sectors, IDC&rsquo;s Carosella says AEC and manufacturing are in the midst of a deep reset. On average, her team found that 37% of companies are in the most advanced stages of digital maturity&mdash;up from 31% in 2019. The acceleration has come about thanks to pandemic-related demands, such as the shift to remote work, but more crucially by the need to find new ways to understand customers and outpace competitors.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;From remote field service operations to augmented and predictive asset maintenance to digital twins, digital investments have become a critical source of competitive advantage for companies and will keep growing at double-digit rates through 2024,&rdquo; she says.<\/p>"},

In 1970 the leaders at NASA Mission Control had to scramble to find the answer when <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Apollo_13\">Apollo 13<\/a> was disabled by a mid-flight explosion.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>They pivoted quickly, setting up their top engineers on a high-fidelity simulator to test repair scenarios in what would eventually be considered a forerunner of the digital twin&mdash;a digital environment used to model likely outcomes on the offline world. Their efforts worked: The crew returned safely back to Earth less than a week later.<\/p>\n\n<p>That was 50 years ago, but even if using computer-driven models to solve problems isn&rsquo;t new, the arrival of increasingly sophisticated 3D simulations is dramatically expanding their application.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Back on Earth, today&rsquo;s digital twins are helping AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) firms build parallel virtual and physical assets. The business value? Better results.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>By combining real-time data, physical dependency models, and intelligence from a variety of systems, new projects can be simulated across their lifecycle to predict and improve real-life performance&mdash;and profitability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>As the fallout from the pandemic continues to accelerate digital transformation, that capability is taking the industry by storm.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Improving Management at the Micro Level&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Industry experts say that&rsquo;s exactly what construction and property management leaders have always wanted&mdash;an operational crystal ball that delivers pinpoint visibility of KPIs across the lifecycle of an asset.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Previous 3D solutions weren&#39;t user friendly enough to use outside of specialty architecture and engineering fields, but today&#39;s digital twins are more aligned to building performance and portfolio management. This makes them much more accessible for client interpretation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Broadening the audience application has given digital twin technology a chance to show its value. As with many other technology tools, the stark necessities of pandemic and post-pandemic life allowed digital twins to shine.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Building sites were among the first to be allowed out of lockdown, although it was <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/reopening-construction\/\">anything but a return to normal<\/a>. New rules for personal protective equipment (PPE) and social distancing necessitated a complete project management rethink. As much work and fabrication had to be done off site as possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Digital twins helped ease that process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;With digital twins you can have a one-to-one fidelity with the physical building right down to the bolts, even before you build,&rdquo; said William Ruh, chief executive officer of Lendlease Digital and a member of the Digital Twin Consortium steering committee.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Speaking to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rtinsights.com\/digital-twin-in-construction-lendlease-leads-a-revolution\/\">RTInsights<\/a> in 2020, he explained that having a virtual copy of a building allows you to optimize it. That is changing the AEC industry &ldquo;in the same way we&rsquo;ve seen aviation and other industries impacted by their use of digital twins.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Nicolas Mangon, VP of AEC strategy at Autodesk, says &ldquo;before COVID, clients were telling us that digital transformation would be a five-year process. Under COVID, they did it in six months.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What&#39;s happened in the last few years is that they&#39;ve realized how valuable digital twins can be in the <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/post-construction\">post-construction<\/a> phase. Something like 70% of the cost of ownership happens after a building becomes operational. Suddenly having a virtual copy you can use to control costs and improve the building user experience has been a kind of revelation.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Preparing for Change at the Macro Level&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Digital twins can also help AEC firms address megatrends like rapid urbanization, onshoring of manufacturing capacity, the impact of the Biden administration&rsquo;s national infrastructure plan, the European Green Deal, and pan-national regulatory changes that will see harmonized building codes designed for future pandemics.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The impact of any one of those could be sector-defining, which is one reason behind the formation of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitaltwinconsortium.org\/\">Digital Twin Consortium<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The group was formed to establish a single definition of digital twin to dispel any market confusion. With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitaltwinconsortium.org\/initiatives\/the-definition-of-a-digital-twin.htm\">that objective now achieved<\/a>, they&rsquo;ve moved on to promoting the concept of digital twins within the AEC and manufacturing industries, and developing technology standards to encourage greater interoperability and cooperation between partners.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Microsoft is leading the consortium&rsquo;s efforts on a common storage solution for IoT data pulled from building sensors. Autodesk is leading efforts around a common digital twin platform. Other initiatives are being led by AEC industry giants like Lendlease, and technology and engineering leaders including Dell, Northrop Grumman, and GE Digital.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Setting the Stage for Mass Urbanization&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Autodesk&rsquo;s Mangon says that as digital twins expand their footprint, they&rsquo;ll enable the AEC industry to guide the population shift to living in cities and help ensure it happens in an organized and sustainable way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Today, there are 3.5 billion people living in cities, he says. &ldquo;In 30 years, that number will double. It took us a few thousand years to build everything we have now. In the next 30, we&rsquo;ll need to add the equivalent residential and commercial capacity of all the cities that exist today.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The AEC industry won&rsquo;t be able to achieve that without software to streamline and simplify planning and design. But even before that phase begins, we will need to know which buildings and materials perform best&mdash;and why.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Final Frontier?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Accenture&rsquo;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.accenture.com\/us-en\/insights\/technology\/technology-trends-2021\">Technology Vision Report<\/a> named digital twins one of the five defining technology trends of the last year. Researchers said they&rsquo;ve become integral to a growing industrial &ldquo;metaverse&rdquo; where whole office towers, factories, supply chains, and product life cycles are represented digitally.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ushering in new opportunities for enterprise leaders to bring data and intelligence together, to ask and answer big questions, then rethink how they operate, collaborate, and innovate.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s a long way from the days of Apollo 13, whose original twin was created when computers couldn&rsquo;t even display images. That solution was little more than a blinking diode compared to what&#39;s available today, yet it was powerful enough to bring a broken spaceship home.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>From those beginnings, perhaps it&rsquo;s no surprise that the next frontier for digital twins is to solve planet-sized problems. European researchers are using the technology to model global climate outcomes and inform EU green policymaking.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h3>What&rsquo;s a Digital Twin?&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n<p>AEC companies can now generate super-realistic virtual versions of the buildings they create, each one perfectly twinned to its steel, glass, and concrete original.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Digital twins are the logical evolution of 3D modeling, taking the concept beyond the creation of on-screen mockups that add depth to a rendered image. A twin receives real-time data from the built asset it mirrors.<\/p>\n\n<p>BIM, or Building Information Modeling, is the best process on which to base the creation of a digital twin. A hyper-realistic BIM-based model will let users preview how a building will look and feel once it&rsquo;s constructed. In the design phase, this can be used in place of paper drawings. Instead, architects will have a 3D render that lets them not only see but &ldquo;experience&rdquo; a new building&mdash;inside and out. Engineers can then use the BIM model to experiment with different structural elements and materials to test their performance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>When the real-world building finally opens its doors, a BIM model turns into a digital twin of the built asset.

But there&#39;s still much to accomplish before people can seamlessly <a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/videos-2\/how-do-we-realize-the-potential-of-big-data-and-smart-technology\">share data<\/a> across multiple industries.<\/p>\n\n<p>Recently, a panel of experts from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\">Microsoft<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinstry.com\/\">McKinstry<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/movielabs.com\/\">MovieLabs<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.emerson.com\/en-us\/global\">Emerson<\/a> came together to discuss all things data&mdash;including where things are today and where things still need to go for true cross-industry <a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/cross-industry\/why-leaders-should-embrace-convergence\">collaboration<\/a>. Four key insights emerged:<\/p>\n\n<h2>1. Cross-industry data-sharing challenges go beyond the application programming interface. There&rsquo;s a need to tackle the human component, too.<\/h2>\n\n<p>With historically separate industries&mdash;from architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) to <a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/design-manufacturing\">design &amp; manufacturing<\/a> (D&amp;M)&mdash;<a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/business-benefits-of-convergence\/\">converging<\/a>, businesses face challenges beyond the API, according to Susan Etlinger, director of artificial intelligence and innovation at Microsoft. The measures of success are different for a designer versus an engineer. Leaders need to think about the handoffs and how to <a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/design-manufacturing\/whitepaper-the-digital-transformation-of-the-manufacturing-industry\">digitalize<\/a> with a better understanding of each other&rsquo;s domains.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost like a human API in which we can convey success from one stage to another,&rdquo; Etlinger said. &ldquo;Technology and data are critical, but that human understanding of standards and how each individual sees the world are also really important.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h2>2. Collaboration means more than just a common data environment.<\/h2>\n\n<p>According to Dace Campbell, director of product management at McKinstry, the term &ldquo;collaboration&rdquo; is often incorrectly associated with simply sharing data in a common environment. True shared, task-based collaboration will go far beyond that.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our ability to work together is enabled&mdash;but also limited&mdash;by our ability to agree on how and where to store data,&rdquo; Campbell said. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not enough. We need to be able to work together and make informed, collective, consensus-based decisions, and today&rsquo;s tools and workflows don&rsquo;t enable full <a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/articles-2\/what-it-really-means-to-collaborate-in-aec\">collaboration<\/a> across our industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;For example, when you take an extended road trip, you need to do more than agree on who will hold the keys or what road to take. You need to actively take your turn behind the wheel, adding individual value to the greater shared process, even if it&rsquo;s not your car.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h2>3. Open-source sharing among media, entertainment, and AEC will spur new ways of working.<\/h2>\n\n<p>Mark Turner, program director of production technology at MovieLabs, shared that there is an incredible opportunity for multi-industry collaboration between <a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/aec\">AEC<\/a> and media and entertainment (M&amp;E). The challenge is figuring out how to handle complex data payloads, such as sharing a 3D model between two companies that may use different file formats or software types.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once there&rsquo;s an open-source way to share that data, AEC firms could tap into millions of CG models originally created for feature films to help populate architectural designs. At the same time, AEC&rsquo;s virtual environments could be leveraged to create more accurate visual effects scenes.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of wasted recreation of assets going on in our different silos because we can&rsquo;t pass a sort of standard payload between different parts of a workflow,&rdquo; Turner said.<\/p>\n\n<h2>4.<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> <\/span>Security and sharing data remain a challenge for industrial applications.<\/h2>\n\n<p>Brad Budde, vice president of digital at Emerson&rsquo;s Automation Solutions business, noted that customers are drowning in data. New AI tools can help sort through the noise, which will promote faster decision-making. But there&rsquo;s a catch.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The tension is that often the data in these industrial applications is viewed to be confidential or restricted for national security purposes,&rdquo; Budde said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this complex situation of whether we can share it or not, and then, if we can, how do we share.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Almost every industry is transitioning to a data-first strategy. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/smarterwithgartner\/data-sharing-is-a-business-necessity-to-accelerate-digital-business\">Gartner<\/a> estimates that firms that share data externally generate three times more measurable economic benefit than those who do not. Increasingly, high quality, well-federated data is becoming a valuable commodity, and successful organizations will find a way to maximize and monetize it.<\/p>"},

The pandemic altered reality for technology teams in every business, yet most CIOs spent the last 18 months in familiar territory: provisioning VPNs and laptops&mdash;albeit for a vast cohort of suddenly-remote workers.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Caught between old and new&rdquo;&nbsp;describes the situation in other ways. Research from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/mckinsey-digital\/our-insights\/can-it-rise-to-the-digital-challenge\">McKinsey<\/a> states there&rsquo;s &ldquo;never been a worse time to be an <em>average<\/em> CIO.&rdquo;&nbsp; As <a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/articles-2\/5-investment-strategies-to-accelerate-digital-transformation-rois\">digital transformation<\/a> puts technology at the center of corporate planning, CIOs are expected to feed into and even drive vital elements of company strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The role has been moving in that direction for years, but the pandemic is pushing every IT leader to leapfrog out of yesterday&rsquo;s responsibilities and into tomorrow&rsquo;s. Boards want CIOs to stop focusing on managing technology and work out how to turn those investments into business value instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>As technology reveals new revenue and <a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/cross-industry\/does-the-next-normal-require-a-change-of-business-model\">operating models<\/a>, organizational success depends on how quickly a CIO can make the move from functional to strategic leadership. But what does that mean when warp-speed digital adoption has pulled the future <a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/articles-2\/is-it-really-2021-not-according-to-the-data\">forward by years<\/a> in just a few months?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>From Cost Center to Income Generator&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/articles-2\/three-minutes-with-laurent-pulce-cio-of-veolia-water-technologies\">Laurent Pulce<\/a>, CIO at Veolia Water Technologies says he experienced a crossover moment when his role moved from a Capex to an Opex function.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;At the beginning of my career, IT was seen as a Capex consumer and fell under the responsibility of the CFO. But progressively, we moved more and more under operations, and now I report directly to the CEO. That means when I speak, it&rsquo;s not just IT&rsquo;s voice, but a voice heard by an exco member.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In his 20 years with the Paris-based utility tech giant, Pulce has witnessed the CIO role evolution play out in real time, &ldquo;moving from a back office to a front office role.&rdquo;&nbsp; While the arrival of the cloud was the catalyst, he says the real game-changer came when digital presented an opportunity to develop &lsquo;pay as you go&rsquo; delivery models for what had always been locally installed solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;In the past, we had a very powerful but also very complex on-premise system for utility clients. It could be painful to install and secure at each plant and required significant upfront expenditure,&rdquo; he explains.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;As more and more of our solution backend moved to the cloud, we were able to offer clients the same functionality, but as a pay-as-you-go service. That meant we could make our solution available on a trial basis, and take advantage of flexible computing costs that were more aligned to our revenues. In other words, we were only paying for the cloud capacity we needed at any given time.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The move to a SaaS model has also enabled the company to advance its <a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/sustainability\">sustainability<\/a> objectives. In the past, Veolia had some 1000 servers deployed worldwide, many of them running at only 25% capacity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;As an environmental company that kind of inefficiency is unacceptable,&rdquo; Pulce adds. &ldquo;Moving to the cloud has been a good way to reduce power consumption and by extension our carbon footprint. It also showed that being a sustainable company involves every department. Environmental factors are now central to the decisions we make in our IT department, and everyone understands the impact they have to contribute to this.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Transformative CIO&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Pulce&rsquo;s experience of innovation-driven leadership mirrors McKinsey&rsquo;s analysis of what defines the role today. What they call the &ldquo;transformative CIO&rdquo;&nbsp; is a business leader who takes responsibility for initiatives that generate revenue.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>They take the time to get to know the business and understand each department&rsquo;s priorities and objectives, going &ldquo;far beyond meeting with the CEO or attending strategy meetings. They invest time with business-unit and functional leaders to gain a deeper, current understanding of business realities on the ground.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Autodesk CIO Prakash Kota says that the learning process has to include <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/the-next-normal\/\">data capture<\/a> and analysis. Operating models, methods, and processes are all changing rapidly. CIOs need to be able to deliver insights about broader internal harmony as organizations undergo an extended <a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/videos\/session-seven\">period of flux<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We can give guidance to senior leadership and let them know what we are seeing. If teams are having a positive impact, how are they operating? Or if we see indications of negative sentiment from a team, how do we reach out to them?&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>If McKinsey researchers are correct, today&rsquo;s transformative CIOs act on information gathered from all levels of the organization and use it to articulate the &lsquo;why&rsquo; behind a particular digital-driven shift or change in focus.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Becoming a Change Agent&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Some CIOs are even changing the culture of the business, giving non-tech managers a clear understanding of the drivers behind a digital move while providing the vocabulary to explain it effectively to customers and stakeholders. Within tech teams, they&#39;re promoting tighter collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Anticipating the skill sets the organization will need in the future and helping shape the overall talent strategy often falls naturally into this process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Veolia&rsquo;s Pulce says that to succeed, CIOs have to accept that digital transformation is about more than the cloud; there&#39;s a human transformation underway as well.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>He explains that during the course of Veolia&rsquo;s own digital journey over the past six years, his team has trained or <a href=\"https:\/\/converge.autodesk.com\/cross-industry\/bridging-the-manufacturing-and-construction-skills-gap-supporting-worker-success-in-the-age-of-automation-2\">re-trained<\/a> everybody in the business (to understand this new model), from the personal assistant to the support team and beyond.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We realized that innovation wasn&#39;t just bringing technological change, it was changing how everyone worked and how positions were defined. In the IT team, we experienced a drastic change. I had young specialists coming into my office saying, &#39;I&#39;m an engineer specializing in servers. What will I do in two years?&rsquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;OK guys, you&rsquo;re right. We have completely changed the organization, and there are no more infrastructure departments. But don&rsquo;t worry. Your skills will be valuable for something else.&rsquo; Roles have evolved, and that&rsquo;s proven to be true.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>"},

For most organizations, <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/digital-investment-strategies\">digital strategy<\/a> is now impossible to separate from business strategy. Boards are taking notice\u2060&mdash;even when they weren&rsquo;t previously engaged with IT.<\/p>\n\n<p>This means CIOs now have a bigger voice than ever before, as well as expanded responsibilities to go with it. Today, they&rsquo;re no longer just managing in-house technology: They&rsquo;re stepping up to play a critical role in delivering almost every business goal. But how can businesses leverage this broadened skill set to face organizational challenges, kick-start innovation, and drive growth in the wake of the pandemic?<\/p>\n\n<p>Recently, a panel of CIOs from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/kimley-horn\/\">Kimley-Horn<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.turnerconstruction.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Turner Construction<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/autodesk.com\">Autodesk<\/a> came together to find the answer at Autodesk&rsquo;s latest CIO Exchange event. Six key insights emerged.<\/p>\n\n<h2>1. Don&rsquo;t Just Throw Technology at a Problem<\/h2>\n\n<p>As tools get more advanced, it can become all too easy to throw new technologies at a problem, without taking care of the basics first. &ldquo;[There are] all these cool things we can now do with technology, but I believe it&#39;s fairly meaningless if your systems aren&rsquo;t up and running,&rdquo; says Kimley-Horn CIO Nick Otto. &ldquo;We have a hyper focus on those basics, and as we&#39;re growing and scaling, that focus is serving us well.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;CIOs are generally seen as technology leaders, and these days, we&rsquo;re all expected to understand the business opportunity or the business problem before we immediately turn to the technology and not be enamored by the technology alone,&rdquo; agrees Warren Kudman, senior vice president and CIO at Turner Construction. &ldquo;If we have that skill, we&rsquo;ve demonstrated our ability to be solid business partners and run effective organizations.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Man in yellow hard hat looking at laptop on job site\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmE5MDQyOWU1Njc3LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTA3M2ExM2JjZTQ4ZmVjMTJiODViNWI1Yjc0NjU4ZjA2\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">It&rsquo;s important to address core business systems before applying technology to solve a problem.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2>2. Prioritize Frictionless Experiences to Stimulate Growth<\/h2>\n\n<p>According to Autodesk CIO Prakash Kota, creating a seamless experience for existing users is key to business growth. &ldquo;One thing that has happened to all of us is our patience level has gone down significantly whether we realize it or not, because whatever we need, we need it instantaneously,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it is very important for us to understand how we continue to create frictionless experiences for our users, whether that&rsquo;s employees, partners, or customers,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;While it is very important to add new customers or expand existing customers, it&#39;s also very important to retain customers, which means it&rsquo;s all about engagement.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h2>3. Use the Right Tools to Attract the Right Talent<\/h2>\n\n<p>Turner Construction&rsquo;s Kudman shared that, in his experience, young engineers are now incredibly comfortable with new technology. Although flexible working practices help attract top talent, he explained that providing enterprise-grade platforms is essential, too. This will not only make new recruits&rsquo; lives easier but also encourage them to be innovative without being too focused on cost.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this bottoms-up part of our overall strategy, which is find innovators and support them with the development of their prototypes and proofs of concepts: their experiments. They have to have the right platforms to let them do that,&rdquo; Kudman says. &ldquo;Part of our job is to keep those innovations or those developments within certain guardrails, and then for the ones that have proved value, ask, &lsquo;How do we help that scale across the enterprise?&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"woman in glassing looking at desktop screen with techy overlay\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmE5MDQ4NDM3YTBkLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWQ2YTg4M2U2YzA0NjkyMmE1NTFkNGU5NmExNTYzYWZi\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Businesses embarking on a data-first journey should start small and set manageable expectations.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2>4. Start Small to Get the Most Value From Data<\/h2>\n\n<p>For years, many CIOs have been inspired by the possibilities of artificial intelligence (AI). Businesses everywhere are drowning in data, and AI could help them stay afloat. One day, it might even do things like analyze the financial patterns in projects and give advanced warning when work is about to go south. To begin taking steps toward this future, however, companies need to prioritize a <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/data-driven-decision-making2\">data-first strategy<\/a> that sets the right expectations, according to Kota.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What has happened is that we&rsquo;ve created hype whenever we buy a new technology and work to evaluate whether or not the tool will help us understand our data,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I think setting the right expectations, taking smaller use cases, solving, and iterating are the most important things that I&#39;ve seen work. It&rsquo;s a journey that has only just begun.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h2>5. Hide Complexity With Automation in Hypergrowth Stages<\/h2>\n\n<p>How do CIOs minimize added complexity when the business is growing fast and even acquiring other companies? One solution is automation.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;While it is phenomenal, hypergrowth can sometimes be a little scary for technology leaders who need to ensure that everyone is collaborating and connecting and engaging properly,&rdquo; Kota says. &ldquo;When you want to embark on a journey beyond $5 billion to get to $10 billion, it requires different skill sets and different mindsets. My biggest focus is, how do I leverage automation? Automation helps hide complexity and provides the required system capabilities for onboarding different users.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"A group of people meet in an office\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmE5MDRhMzI1MDI1LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWM0OWYzZDJlOWEwYjIwNjIxNWM0ZTI3OWUzODNiNjQ5\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">It&rsquo;s time to evaluate pandemic-era workflows for efficiency in a post-pandemic era.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2>6. Consider Reintroducing Pre-Pandemic Workflows<\/h2>\n\n<p>Kimley-Horn&rsquo;s Otto noted that it&rsquo;s now good practice to review workflows that were introduced during the pandemic and think about whether businesses truly need all of them to work efficiently in the post-pandemic era.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever worked as hard for such a consistently long period of time as I did in the first 100 days of the pandemic,&rdquo; Otto says. &ldquo;To keep the business running, we had to get people productive and effective at home in a very quick fashion. We needed to quickly implement things without full testing or thinking about how they might fit long-term in our environment.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Otto explains that, today, his team is starting to review and phase out some of the technologies that were initially implemented during the pandemic. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re being very specific and methodical about what changes will help us preserve a culture, allowing us to continue to grow and create an environment for our employees to flourish in the future.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Gain more insights from Autodesk CIO Prakash Kota and other thought leaders at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/autodesk-university\/conference\/overview\">Autodesk University 2022<\/a> in New Orleans, Sept. 27&ndash;29.<\/em><\/p>"},

It also comes with significant drawbacks: The production of cement, a key ingredient in concrete, creates approximately <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-46455844\" target=\"_blank\">8%<\/a> of global greenhouse gas emissions. To offset this, building materials companies are adopting <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/videos\/circular-economy-sustainability\">circular economy<\/a> models to accelerate low-carbon and carbon-neutral products. There are similar challenges&mdash;and responsibilities&mdash;for the modern steel industry. Although steel is recyclable, steelmaking generates up to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.carbonbrief.org\/guest-post-these-553-steel-plants-are-responsible-for-9-of-global-co2-emissions\/\" target=\"_blank\">11%<\/a> of global greenhouse gas emissions. To counter this, the steel industry has worked to proactively <a href=\"https:\/\/superiorsteelfab.com\/precision-metal-fabrication\/sustainable-steel-fabrication\/\" target=\"_blank\">reduce<\/a> emissions and waste, decreasing its environmental impact.<\/p><p>And then there&rsquo;s timber. Deforestation causes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldwildlife.org\/industries\/timber\" target=\"_blank\">15%<\/a> of global greenhouse gas emissions, but wood that&rsquo;s harvested from sustainably managed forests actually absorbs more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it emits. That&rsquo;s because trees don&rsquo;t just ingest carbon dioxide; they also store it. When trees are felled for timber, the carbon inside them stays there until the wood is burned or decays, making <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/mass-timber\">timber<\/a> one of the most sustainable building materials.<\/p><p>But timber is neither infinite nor clean. Trees can be replanted, but it takes years or decades for forests to regenerate. And though trees sequester carbon, timber production, transportation, and construction still emit it.<\/p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmI0YTFhZGQyOTM3LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTIzN2Q1M2UwOWE3NjQyYmQ4MDVlZTFjY2Y4NTM0N2Ni\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The SPLAM pavilion is constructed from 912 pieces of wood.

At scale, both the material and the research-driven process that created it could help the architecture, engineering, and construction industry reach new heights of sustainability and innovation.<\/p><h2>From CLT to SLT<\/h2><p>SOM created SLT as part of an advanced technology research project for the 2021 Chicago Architecture Biennial. Developed with students from the University of Michigan&rsquo;s Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, SLT was inspired by cross-laminated timber (CLT), an engineered wood product made by gluing together layers of kiln-dried lumber in a crisscross pattern that gives it structural strength and integrity. Unlike CLT, however, SLT uses smaller, precision-cut 2x4s woven together like fabric via interlocking timber joints, then layered densely in places needing more structural support and sparsely in places that don&rsquo;t.<\/p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmI0YTFlY2VkZDczLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWE3MzkzNDgwNDcxOWNlMzIwYjVkZDY3MzRkMDJjNDU2\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fabricators use a CNC machine to shape and cut precise wood pieces that will be assembled on-site. Courtesy of Dave Burk.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>&ldquo;One of the challenges with a standard CLT system is the size of plank that&rsquo;s required and the amount of time and space it takes to grow trees at that scale,&rdquo; says SOM Design Partner Scott Duncan. &ldquo;With a smaller piece of wood, you&rsquo;re able to grow it more quickly, and you can utilize less desirable parts of the tree that are often thrown away. You could even use salvaged pieces of deconstructed buildings.&rdquo; By using small and salvaged pieces of wood, SLT can reduce timber consumption by 46% compared to conventional timber panels, SOM estimates.<\/p><p>A secondary benefit, according to Duncan, is that SLT allows for better placement of building services such as ductwork, lighting, and sprinklers. Normally, those have to be placed below structural wooden beams, which forces walls to be built taller than they otherwise might be. With SLT, building services can be embedded within timber instead of layered below it, which means buildings can achieve the same interior ceiling heights with shorter exterior walls.<\/p><p>&ldquo;After the structure, a lot of the embodied carbon in a building comes from the exterior cladding,&rdquo; says Duncan, who cites glass and aluminum as typical high-carbon cladding materials. &ldquo;So to the extent that you can reduce the height of the exterior wall, you can reduce the amount of material that goes into it.&rdquo;<\/p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmI0YTIyYmRjYzM0LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWIwMzc2NjZmZDc1YjU2NjYzZDdjNjcwZDc5YzgzNjQ5\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Spatial laminated timber uses precision-cut 2x4s that are woven together via interlocking joints. Courtesy of Dave Burk.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Technology is a key enabler of SLT, according to Tsz Yan Ng, associate professor of architecture at the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning. First, spatial analysts use computational modeling to determine an optimal layout&mdash;that is, how many layers of SLT latticework are needed in order to maximize structural integrity while minimizing materials. Then, fabricators in a laboratory use a CNC machine to robotically shape and cut precise wood pieces to be assembled onsite.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Technology is never about any one singular solution. It&rsquo;s about processes and modes of working,&rdquo; Ng says. &ldquo;Here, we&rsquo;re using it to elevate this ubiquitous material that is so popular in North American construction and to rethink it in a way that saves material when we use it.&rdquo;<\/p><h2>An &ldquo;EPIC&rdquo; Demonstration<\/h2><p>To demonstrate the benefits of SLT, SOM and Taubman designed and built a full-scale prototype of a single-story structural framing system used in midrise, fire-resistant construction: a timber pavilion they call <a href=\"https:\/\/www.som.com\/research\/splam-timber-pavilion\/\" target=\"_blank\">SPLAM<\/a>&mdash;short for spatial laminated timber.<\/p><p>Comprising 412 SLT panels made from 912 pieces of wood, the SPLAM pavilion stands on the campus of EPIC Academy, a public charter high school on Chicago&rsquo;s South Side.

Courtesy of SOM.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>&ldquo;Instead of just creating a proof of concept that would end up in a landfill, we wanted to make a pavilion that would actually be used,&rdquo; says Ng, who cites as inspiration the Freedom Schools of the 1960s&mdash;temporary, alternative schools organized by leaders of the Civil Rights Movement that offered spaces for Black students and parents to become engaged voters and citizens. &ldquo;We were working at the height of the pandemic, when it was actually safer to be outside than inside, and during the period of Black Lives Matter,&rdquo; Ng says. &ldquo;Freedom Schools were informal gatherings where education was about civic participation and growing as a community, and we saw an opportunity to connect to that history by creating an open and flexible learning space.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Although students at EPIC are using the SPLAM pavilion, students at Taubman helped create it, according to Ng, who says Master of Architecture students spent an entire academic year conceiving and testing SLT prototypes in close collaboration with SOM engineers.<\/p><p>SOM used Autodesk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/revit\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">Revit<\/a> to track the entire design: The drawings were used to assemble every part of the project and document every element in the building. All of the modeling done in Revit was communicated to the contractor\/builder to expedite construction. Finally, the layout for the 2x4s required highly articulated joints and predrilled screw holders located in precise locations; this work was done in Autodesk Dynamo, which was also used to create the animation that was sent along to guide the contractor. Once the concept was proven, the design finalized, and the scripts programmed, fabrication and installation took just a week each.<\/p><p><iframe border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"103\" scroll=\"none\" src=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/hubsFront\/embed_cta\/477251\" width=\"250\"><\/iframe><\/p><h2>Scaling for the Future<\/h2><p>SPLAM&rsquo;s immediate benefit as a school and community space is obvious.

Because we&rsquo;re often working at a large scale on very complex projects, there&rsquo;s a need to innovate by relying on our own past experience.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Research-based projects are opportunities to create experience where there is none&mdash;to build the first step in what might eventually become a grand staircase to new levels of efficiency and productivity. In that way, proofs of concept can end up supporting real, commissioned work.<\/p><p>But it doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight. To transform innovation into application, firms that sponsor research must invest in the infrastructure to scale it.<\/p><p>&ldquo;A surprisingly important factor in applying new ideas is the role of the contractor,&rdquo; says Duncan, who suggests &ldquo;pressure testing&rdquo; new ideas with construction partners to determine their feasibility for the construction workforce. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing to make something in a lab under the right conditions, but it&rsquo;s quite something else to do it on a real construction site.&rdquo;<\/p><p>It&rsquo;s not enough for a new innovation to work. When real dollars from paying clients are at stake, it has to work as quickly and affordably as conventional methods and materials.<\/p><p>&ldquo;To implement new ideas at a larger scale, it&rsquo;s important to understand the building industry as it currently exists,&rdquo; Ng says. &ldquo;So a proof of concept is not just a thing; it&rsquo;s also the process and having a workforce that can deliver on the process.&rdquo;<\/p><p>To make their visions real, innovators must be willing to take on new roles and responsibilities. Firms that are used to designing, engineering, and building, for instance, must also get comfortable teaching, training, and evangelizing.<\/p><p>&ldquo;If your goal is to do something that&rsquo;s never been done, it&rsquo;s critical to step outside your lane,&rdquo; says Duncan, who adds that SLT and future innovations like it will help SOM reduce construction costs and carbon. &ldquo;We try to align environmental efficiency with economic efficiency, and structure&mdash;the wooden stud&mdash;is one really promising area in which we can do that.&rdquo;<\/p>"},

This results in projects getting delayed, teams working in silos, lost time, lost money, and an environmental impact that has become unjustifiable in today&rsquo;s world. McKinsey Global Institute <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/industries\/private-equity-and-principal-investors\/our-insights\/rise-of-the-platform-era-the-next-chapter-in-construction-technology\" target=\"_blank\">reports<\/a> a global productivity gap of $1.2 trillion, which can be mitigated simply by improving the performance of the industry. The industry is snapping into action: Investing in new ways of working driven by technology has more than doubled in the past decade.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although many software, hardware, and cloud-based tools will contribute to this shift, ultimately the biggest change will be digital project delivery: digitized workflows that enable better collaboration and seamless flow of data throughout the project lifecycle&mdash;from planning and design to construction and operation. During the past 20 years, the <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/bim-building-information-modeling\">building information modeling<\/a> (BIM) process has established digital workflows across the <a href=\"https:\/\/damassets.autodesk.net\/content\/dam\/autodesk\/www\/industry\/aec\/bim\/aec-bim-study-smart-market-synopsis-ebook-en.pdf\">AEC sector<\/a>; 60% of architects and 51% of MEP and structural engineers use it. In a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/assets.kpmg\/content\/dam\/kpmg\/xx\/pdf\/2021\/08\/global-construction-survey1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">KMPG survey<\/a> (PDF, p. 34), 42% of construction industry expert respondents say that BIM has the greatest potential for high returns. And in a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/content\/dam\/Deloitte\/us\/Documents\/energy-resources\/us-2022-outlook-engineering-and-construction.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Deloitte survey<\/a> (PDF, p. 5), 43% of engineering and construction executives predicted greater investments in new design processes, such as focusing on BIM, in the next year. Digital project delivery accelerates and expands the adoption of BIM in design to construction and ultimately into operations of capital assets.<\/p>\n\n<p>Digitizing every decision that goes into creating a building or piece of infrastructure is a tall order with an intense learning curve&mdash;one that offers unparalleled rewards, including greater efficiency, reduced risk, better quality, improved communication, and information accessibility. The methods used to design capital assets in the past&mdash;a pile of construction drawings over here, hand sketches over there, 3D models on one network, a series of change orders from the client on another network, and reams of PDFs in-between&mdash;coalesce into a single digital environment, where their accessibility and mutability will create digital assets just as responsive and efficient as the data itself.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-digital-project\">What Is Digital Project Delivery?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Quite simply: Digital project delivery is a way of working in which projects are conceived, planned, designed, built, and operated in an interactive digital space that all stakeholders can access. This includes every team member: the client, architects, engineers, builders, trades, and even local residents.<\/p>\n\n<p>Digital project delivery encompasses design collaboration, design management, and construction management. Design collaboration has a narrow focus within the design team, allowing content creators to work together through a managed process centered around a common digital model. Design management is broader, allowing individuals who work outside of a project&rsquo;s content creation to manage risk, cost, and safety and identify roadblocks through a common data environment.<\/p>\n\n<h3>What Is a Common Data Environment?<\/h3>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/data-interoperability\">common data environment<\/a><span style=\"color:black\"> (CDE) is a central repository where project data and information are stored. It allows project teams to better collaborate around a digital process, from the initial ideation through design, construction, and operations. A CDE extends the value of data created through the BIM process; it can encompass 3D models, construction documentation, project contracts, schedules, change orders, and more. At all points, this shared language of data is structured and streamlined for real-time collaboration, which enables data-driven decision making and mitigates project risk.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<figure><strong><strong><span style=\"color:black\"><img alt=\"digital project delivery office workers collaborating\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmIzOGQ3N2M1ZTczLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWZjOTc5NDhiYzYyZTAwOGY5NDBjMWFkMTJkNGVjMjYz\" \/> <\/span><\/strong> <\/strong>\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"color:black\">In a common data environment, team members collaborate through cloud-based standardized workflows and shared data language.<\/span><\/figcaption>\n<strong> <strong><span style=\"color:black\"> <\/span><\/strong><\/strong><\/figure>\n\n<p>A CDE also improves communication across project stakeholders and enables the digital handover of an asset as a digital twin to extend the value of the BIM process into operations. <a href=\"https:\/\/construction.autodesk.com\/\"><span style=\"color:#954f72\">Autodesk Construction Cloud<\/span><\/a><span style=\"color:black\">&mdash;which connects workflows, teams, and data&mdash;<\/span><span style=\"color:black\">supports both design and construction professionals on a common data platform and unified experience and includes support for industry standards such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/autodesk-university\/article\/ISO-19650-Common-Data-Environment-and-Autodesk-Construction-Cloud\">ISO 19650<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>Of firms that use BIM, 80% say they&rsquo;re&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/damassets.autodesk.net\/content\/dam\/autodesk\/www\/industry\/aec\/bim\/aec-bim-study-smart-market-synopsis-ebook-en.pdf\"><span style=\"color:#954f72\">already<\/span><\/a><span style=\"color:black\">&nbsp;using some form of a CDE.&nbsp;But there&rsquo;s much progress to be made. Almost a third of construction professionals report that none of their software solutions are integrated, and, globally, 52% of rework is still caused by poor data and communication.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h3>What Is a Digital Twin?<\/h3>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/what-is-a-digital-twin\"><span style=\"color:#954f72\">digital twin<\/span><\/a><span style=\"color:black\">&nbsp;is a digital representation of a physical asset: a building, a highway, a bridge, or a water treatment plant. Far from being just a visual and geometric representation of an asset, this digital model is enriched with critical asset data that defines its formal and material characteristics, the manufacturer, installation date, and so on.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>Digital twins enable the visualization, monitoring, and optimization of assets by connecting them to real-time data. A digital twin might track how much water runs through a piping system or analyze energy consumption of a building. Derived from BIM, digital twins with the addition of artificial intelligence and machine learning are becoming sophisticated enough to autonomously troubleshoot problems and simulate what-if scenarios.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Coordinating Data Across Design Teams&mdash;and in the Cloud<\/h3>\n\n<p>The collaboration and coordination of design-team members can be optimized through the cloud, which is what Autodesk&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/bim-collaborate\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription&amp;plc=COLLRP\"><span style=\"color:#954f72\">BIM Collaborate Pro<\/span><\/a><span style=\"color:black\">&nbsp;does.

Builders can bring the model onto the construction site to compare what&rsquo;s being built to what the architects and engineers have designed. The model allows subcontractors&mdash;like plumbing, electrical, HVAC, and other trade professionals&mdash;to double-check how unforeseen conditions on the construction site could affect their work before it even begins.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why\">Why Does Digital Project Delivery Matter Now More Than Ever?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Digital project delivery offers powerful benefits for every member across the project ecosystem. For architects and engineers, co-developing a design through BIM means that all disciplines can collaborate effectively and efficiently around a common and coordinated model. This can identify problems earlier and address inaccurate assumptions well before the project is being built, which reduces the cost of errors and changes in the field.<\/p>\n\n<p>For all members of the project team, digital project delivery helps them be proactive instead of reactive: to use data to distribute responsibility across an entire team evenly so each player can anticipate and solve problems using their expertise throughout the process. When data is transparent, searchable, and exportable, teams can access information earlier to make better decisions that drive better outcomes.<\/p>\n\n<h3>What Challenges Can Be Addressed With Digital Project Delivery?<\/h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:black\">The pandemic has brought radical change to the way people work; it&rsquo;s now essential to offer flexible work hours across home and office time. As people settle into new rhythms&mdash;with work happening at home offices, traditional corporate headquarters, and on jobsites&mdash;working in the cloud with digital project delivery is seamless.<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:black\">Wage inflation, labor shortages, and spiking material prices are pushing owners and operators to improve efficiency and close the productivity gap.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<figure><strong><strong><span style=\"color:black\"><img alt=\"digital project delivery office workers collaborate via zoom\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmIzOTY4ODNmZjdhLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWYzOWUyNDlhZjJkYWEwZWNhZWQ4MjdiZDVlYWJiY2Jj\" \/> <\/span><\/strong> <\/strong>\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"color:black\">Working in the cloud with digital project delivery allows seamless collaboration in post-pandemic remote work models.<\/span><\/figcaption>\n<strong> <strong><span style=\"color:black\"> <\/span><\/strong><\/strong><\/figure>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:black\">Projects are becoming more complex and difficult, and AEC firms are being forced to deliver them with fewer people.&nbsp;There are also more contract rules and digital security protocols than ever before. To manage growing complexity with a shrinking labor pool, AEC firms are looking for a CDE that can manage and document projects.<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:black\">If one AEC firm isn&rsquo;t using digital project delivery, its&nbsp;competitors probably are. As they do, growing industry standards, such as ISO19650, are coming into play. AEC firms need to transition to digital project delivery just to keep up with the way business is done.<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:black\">Projects using digital project delivery offer the potential to be designed and built with less material, in less time, for less money. A recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/damassets.autodesk.net\/content\/dam\/autodesk\/www\/industry\/aec\/bim\/aec-bim-study-smart-market-synopsis-ebook-en.pdf\"><span style=\"color:#954f72\">Autodesk survey<\/span><\/a>&nbsp;reported that approximately half of BIM users experienced reduced design time and reduced emissions from projects when they used a digital process. And 55% said their workforce was able to take on additional capacity.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"benefits\">What Are the Benefits of Digital Project Delivery Today and in the Future?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Digital project delivery provides a work environment free of silos that enables more interaction with team members and less time to deliver projects than traditional ways of working. As projects progress, they accumulate hordes of data that can be leveraged to create operational value for current and future projects.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:black\">When design is digitized, the result is a single source of truth: a dynamic model that all team members can access and revise. Operating within&nbsp;a common model erases nearly all ambiguity and miscommunication inherent in more fragmented design processes, leading to better decision making, fewer errors, and less rework.<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:black\">During construction, this means that mistakes are spotted before concrete is poured and steel beams are welded into place. With a shared and dynamically updated model, builders can constantly check the accuracy of their work.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:black\">After just a few projects, firms that use digital project delivery will find themselves with a wealth of data on how their projects are designed and built. They can understand what works well and where the pain points are at a much greater depth and detail than working in analog processes. This persistence and accessibility of data makes it a great tool to navigate future challenges such as creating more accurate cost estimates and timelines.<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:black\">With digital project delivery, AEC firms can automatically triage issues and RFIs instead of having to manually pick through thousands of issues and distribute them to the right teams.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<figure><strong><strong><span style=\"color:black\"><img alt=\"digital project delivery construction colleagues use ipad on site\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmIzOTdhNzU2OWY3LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWVjYjYzMmY2MDQ3NGE0OWE1OThjODU5MjEyMTA4YWY1\" \/> <\/span><\/strong> <\/strong>\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"color:black\">Using shared, dynamically updated models, builders can check the accuracy of their work before mistakes happen.<\/span><\/figcaption>\n<strong> <strong><span style=\"color:black\"> <\/span><\/strong><\/strong><\/figure>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:black\">With parametrically enhanced building models, changes to one part of the design can automatically ripple throughout the rest of it, reducing the need for manual work.<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:black\">According to a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/content\/dam\/Deloitte\/us\/Documents\/energy-resources\/us-2022-outlook-engineering-and-construction.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Deloitte survey<\/a><span style=\"color:black\"> (PDF, p. 2),&nbsp;<\/span>60% of construction firms are experiencing project delays due to labor shortages<span style=\"color:black\">. In the face of labor shortages and skyrocketing material prices, digital project delivery means fewer change orders and less labor-intensive upfront coordination.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"color:black\">Especially for public assets, AEC firms and their clients aren&rsquo;t just dealing with each other. Digital design can help communication with nondesign stakeholders and the general public, like showing off an interactive model at a community meeting. An Autodesk <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/damassets.autodesk.net\/content\/dam\/autodesk\/www\/industry\/aec\/bim\/aec-bim-study-smart-market-synopsis-ebook-en.pdf\">survey<\/a><span style=\"color:black\"> shows that 54% of respondents think digital project delivery can help increase stakeholder buy-in.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"color:black\">With digital project delivery, the process of planning the design and construction of a building is less carbon-intensive. There is also a decreased need to print&nbsp;files or travel for face-to-face meetings.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"color:black\">The well of data collected using digital project delivery can also be used to refine operational efficiency as new capital assets come online. A more accurate understanding of how assets run can mean more efficient maintenance and operations protocols after construction.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><iframe border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"103\" scroll=\"none\" src=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/hubsFront\/embed_cta\/484858\" width=\"250\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"action\">Digital Project Delivery in Action, Across the Globe<\/h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:black\"><span style=\"color:black\">A look into how digital project delivery changes design and construction reveals that there&rsquo;s no part of the process left untouched.

As digital project delivery advances, it won&rsquo;t be just managing more files, it will be managing granular project and asset data as divisions between file types and platforms fall away and front-end interfaces pull data from a rich cloud information model. As the industry moves from a product- and files-based digital delivery process to a data- and platform-based digital delivery process, it will further unlock the value of the data and dramatically expand the scope of what&rsquo;s possible to become what&rsquo;s probable.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>Digital project delivery already is an essential part of the AEC industry today and will become indispensable in the future. It will touch all aspects of designing, building, and maintaining the built environment. A boon of data, when not effectively used, is really no boon at all. Digital project delivery will mean better insights, leaner operations, more transparency, smarter decisions, and a clearer path to sustainability. And that&rsquo;s good news for everyone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/figure>\n"},

But construction can be a chaotic affair. Pandemics, extreme weather, and geopolitical unrest can break supply chains and smash delivery schedules. Skills shortages make builds harder to deliver on time and on budget.<\/p>\n\n<p>So how are companies in architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) responding? It isn&rsquo;t easy to strip time, cost, and uncertainty out of a build&mdash;especially when advances such as composite flooring, ready-made cladding, and bolt-together systems of every stripe have already streamlined construction processes to the hilt.<\/p>\n\n<p>The answer for many is to rip a page from manufacturing&rsquo;s playbook with a process called design for manufacturing and assembly, or DfMA. DfMA forms part of the growing trend of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Industrialization_of_construction\" target=\"_blank\">industrialized construction<\/a> and manufacturing-informed design, in which building systems and even entire buildings come together as separate but connectable products. DfMA encompasses a set of design choices that enables the productive use of manufactured products and prefabricated assemblies.

The needs of humankind are undeniable, but our capability to deliver these is critically uncertain.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Heathrow extension work at night\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmM2MjFmMDA4ZDBkLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTBjYTNlNDMzMjMxYzlhZTY5NzZkNzYwM2UxYzlkOGQw\" style=\"float:right; margin:20px 25px\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bryden Wood used BIM for the Heathrow airport extension project to ease traffic between the terminal piers.&nbsp;Courtesy of Bryden Wood.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>Bridging that gap requires a serious course correction, Johnston says, because even if it were possible to build enough stuff for enough people fast enough, current approaches would kill the planet.<\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;The disconnect between what we have to build and our capability to deliver it is so vast that we need some sort of technological fix in the middle to make it happen,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The industry has been dancing around these issues for a long time. The difference today is that the rapid adoption of <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/bim-building-information-modeling\">[building information modeling] BIM<\/a> and the digitalization of the industry we&rsquo;ve seen during the pandemic have changed people&#39;s thinking.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Bryden Wood has been applying BIM to major projects for years, perhaps most visibly at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.co.uk\/customer-stories\/bryden-wood-dfma\">high-profile initiatives<\/a> such as extensions to London&#39;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brydenwood.com\/projects\/london-heathrow-t5-nodes\/s3791\/\" target=\"_blank\">Heathrow<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brydenwood.com\/projects\/london-gatwick-south-terminal-pier-1\/s3699\/\" target=\"_blank\">Gatwick<\/a> airports and the massive &ldquo;big dig&rdquo; connecting London&rsquo;s disparate east and west commuter corridors via the Elizabeth Line (formerly Crossrail) project. Each one has relied on designs that incorporate off-site manufacturing and on-site assembly.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Construction Made to Order<\/h2>\n\n<p>The firm&#39;s work for Heathrow and Gatwick airports saw it develop a plan to ease and improve traffic flow between each airport&#39;s terminal &ldquo;piers,&rdquo; where gates and airplanes are clustered to maximize use of space. The project required the installation of more than 1.5 kilometers (about 1 mile) of new corridors.<\/p>\n\n<p>To minimize disruption to travelers, Bryden Wood&rsquo;s design and installation plan involved setting up manufacturing facilities near each airport where entire sections of corridor could be built off-site. Once the sections were completed, they were driven a short hop to the airports for simple assembly on-site.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Interior view of Elizabeth Line extension project\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmM2MjJmZTY2NzIzLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWMwNzBlOWRiZDVmNGRkM2QyYmUwNzllNzEzYTQwYjAz\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bryden Wood designers devised panels that could be manufactured off-site and assembled inside the Elizabeth Line stations.&nbsp;Courtesy of Bryden Wood.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>For the Elizabeth Line project, Bryden Wood was tasked with creating panels to line each new rail tunnel being dug beneath the city at the busy Tottenham Court Road, Liverpool Street, and Whitechapel stations. Applying its DfMA expertise, the firm&rsquo;s designers and engineers came up with a panel that could be manufactured off-site for quick on-site assembly.<\/p>\n\n<p><iframe border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"103\" scroll=\"none\" src=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/hubsFront\/embed_cta\/477251\" width=\"250\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n<h2>A New Approach to Office Space<\/h2>\n\n<p>London&rsquo;s new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brydenwood.com\/projects\/the-forge\/s93059\/\">Forge<\/a> commercial complex, which was built in collaboration with developer Landsec, encompasses two 10-story office blocks rising between the Shard tower and the Tate Modern museum of art, just across the river from St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an amazing part of London, though, as a site, it&rsquo;s very constrained,&rdquo; Johnston says. &ldquo;So, architecturally, the building had to be very responsive to the location. You can&#39;t build in that bit of London without engaging a huge number of stakeholders, so the option of just constructing a building made from large components wasn&lsquo;t really available to us.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Bryden Wood&rsquo;s key innovation for the project was to use a platform construction system originally developed for new-build UK prisons and apply it to office space. Bryden Wood&#39;s modular platforms are product-based, standardized, premade components assembled on-site using the same methodology. It&rsquo;s a bit like modern car production, in which manufacturers create one type of frame or chassis and apply it to multiple car models. The platforms dramatically sped up the completion of each building floor.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Forge components inside a concrete and steel frame\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmM2MjQxMjBjZjhiLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTlhMzZlNTBmYjdkZWIwZmY0ZWFmMGE2MDc0ZWYzNzdk\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The various components of the Forge project snap together and &ldquo;speak&rdquo; to the other components.&nbsp;Courtesy of Bryden Wood.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>The Forge components use 9-meter (29.5-foot) spans inside a steel and concrete hybrid frame. The primary beams come with uniform cutouts already made for utilities and services. Platform columns span from floor to floor and are standardized, with thicker columns on the ground and lower floors to accommodate the loads above.<\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;Rather than invent new systems for each project, we&rsquo;ve been able to create an IKEA-like&nbsp;kit&nbsp;of components that can be used to build anything,&rdquo; Johnston says. &ldquo;Each component snaps to and speaks to every other component, much like Lego.&rdquo; He explains that the platform approach also let the firm&rsquo;s designers automatically generate <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/what-is-a-digital-twin\">digital models<\/a> for the building.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We plugged in some key parameters and it automatically generated a data set that described the building and became the basis for the BIM model,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It was so fast that whenever we made a change to the building, rather than go back and adjust the model, we just generated a new one, which took about 20 minutes. In productivity terms, that was a game changer for us.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>The gains in terms of accuracy and time saved have also been impressive. Because the platforms arrive precut and standardized, time and materials spent fixing and adjusting to tolerance problems typically encountered by finishing trades was cut to almost zero.<\/p>\n\n<p>This productization of building components and manufacturing-informed design enabled the Forge complex to generate 30% less embodied carbon than in a normally constructed building. As a result, it&rsquo;s the first building to meet the UK Green Building Council&rsquo;s definition of a <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/net-zero-carbon\">net-zero<\/a> office.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Cranes outside the Forge complex during construction\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmM2MjRmMmVjZmNmLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTVjMjI1MWE0YmJkYzYyM2M5YzBmMDFjMzk0NzczNjE3\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Thanks to DfMA and industrialized construction techniques, the Forge is the UK&rsquo;s first net-zero building.&nbsp;Courtesy of Bryden Wood.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2>BIM the Enabler<\/h2>\n\n<p>For Johnston, none of this would be possible without BIM. &quot;BIM encourages you to collaborate in a particular way,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In the past, problems could be hidden on 2D drawings until they got to the site. With BIM, you can spatially coordinate things a lot better. You also come to the realization that once you&rsquo;ve put the effort into creating a detailed 3D model, turning that into thousands of drawings to give to individuals on site seems a bit daft.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>According to Johnston, a great example of this was the Elizabeth Line project. Every aspect of the design was modeled first in Autodesk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/revit\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription&amp;plc=RVT\">Revit<\/a>, with&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/dynamo-studio\/overview\">Dynamo<\/a> automatically modeling hundreds of fabrication and assembly options. Bryden Wood used Autodesk&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/navisworks\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription&amp;plc=NAVSIM\">Navisworks<\/a> to optimize the assembly process and create the most efficient delivery-to-assembly sequence.<\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;As an industry, we couldn&rsquo;t fully embrace DfMA until we got the hang of these digital tools,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The propagation of BIM is both a technical and cultural change that enables new ways of working. That&rsquo;s been foundational, and greater adoption of DfMA is one of the things that&#39;s going to come out of it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n"},

BuildCAN visualizes Internet of Things (IoT) environmental sensor information such as temperature, humidity, illumination, and carabon dioxide on the BIM model. This service is based on the Building Information Management System, which was originally developed by Yasunobu Ohnishi Lab at Kumamoto University and won the 10th Japan Facility Management Grand Prize and Technology Award. By adding knowledge from actual building management operations, Yasui can use BuildCAN for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance stages.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Technologies like BIM, big data, IoT, AI, XR, and blockchain are essential to the innovation and digital transformation taking place in various fields and will support the digitization and informatization of buildings and cities in the future,&rdquo; Shigeto says. &ldquo;A <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/what-is-a-digital-twin\">digital twin<\/a> becomes a reality by accumulating sensor information on the environment, earthquakes, and operating conditions, and interconnecting this information with BIM models.&rdquo;<\/p><p><iframe border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"103\" scroll=\"none\" src=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/hubsFront\/embed_cta\/477251\" width=\"250\"><\/iframe><\/p><h2>Getting the Most From BIM Models<\/h2><p>BuildCAN leverages the Autodesk <a href=\"https:\/\/forge.autodesk.com\/\">Forge<\/a>&nbsp;platform to visualize BIM and allows users to view BIM models in a 3D viewer on a web browser. &ldquo;With BuildCAN, multiple buildings can be managed as a group, and centralized management can be achieved, including existing buildings that do not have BIM models,&rdquo; Shigeto says. &ldquo;By using tablets to inspect facilities, BuildCAN also supports maintenance and management operations, such as digitizing inspection work and automating inspection reports.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The environmental management functions display easy-to-understand visualizations of temperature, humidity, illumination, CO2, and other information from IoT environmental sensors on the BIM model.

As Japan moves toward its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, it&rsquo;s essential to reduce energy use and to optimize air-conditioning operations in buildings. HVAC systems have become more complex due to these demands for efficient energy use and non-carbon energy sources. But until now, there has been no communication between design firms and building-management companies once the building is handed over&mdash;the air conditioning operation information from the design stage is not transferred, so energy efficiency cannot be achieved as originally intended.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Currently, it is difficult to fully automate air conditioning operations, so we think it is also necessary to provide a nudge to action from the digital twin, such as, &lsquo;Comfort is not impaired even if the temperature is raised a little more,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;It is better to ventilate now because of high CO2 concentration,&rsquo;&rdquo; Shigeto says. &ldquo;As an entry point for this, we have created a cycle to analyze the operational status by comparing operation data, actual outside temperature data, and electricity data, and then create an operation plan and provide feedback to the building owner.&rdquo;<\/p><figure><img alt=\"yasui architects evacuation simulation\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmQ3MjdiNDU3MzJhLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTcyNDkzZjVmZTAyMGNhYjNhZDlmYzI3YmJlOTU5NjNj\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Simulation of evacuation while experiencing congestion (screen under development).

In this model project, an evacuation-drill simulation using a game engine was also tested.<\/p><p>BuildCAN&rsquo;s development is ongoing. Because interest in CO2 reduction is extremely high, especially among public facility owners, the firm is also looking for ways to measure CO2 and wellness from the design stage, such as analyzing the amount of CO2 associated with building production and disposal to select greener materials and construction methods. It&rsquo;s also continuing to study ways to properly communicate building design intent to building owners and managers.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Buildings and cities are made up of so much information, so it is not easy for the people involved or the manufacturers to build individual systems,&rdquo; Shigeto says. &ldquo;To solve the issues facing Japanese society and create new services, we believe it is important for the government and industry to work hand in hand to build an open infrastructure and platform that is beneficial to society.&rdquo;<\/p>"},

Through exclusive sponsorship from The L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al Group, the exhibit opened in the France Pavilion at the World&rsquo;s Fair in Dubai and was on display at the Coll&egrave;ge des Bernardins in Paris April&ndash;July 2022; it&rsquo;s at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., April&ndash;September 2022. From there, it will travel to Dresden, Germany; New Orleans; and then to a dozen other cities in the next two years.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Histovery offers a deep dive into the cathedral&rsquo;s history and restoration,&rdquo; says Bruno de Sa Moreira, company co-founder and CEO. &ldquo;We aim to make Notre-Dame de Paris accessible, using augmented reality and interactivity in a way that&rsquo;s in line with contemporary scientific knowledge.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>In practical terms, visitors begin the virtual tour using&nbsp;an interactive tablet called a HistoPad. With it, they can explore 3D historical reconstructions from all angles, select the level of visual detail, move virtual objects, open doors, and immerse themselves&mdash;getting lost in the otherwise inaccessible nooks and crannies of scenes from various time periods. As visitors stroll through the exhibit, they can scan terminals that serve as portals to other eras, allowing them to travel back in time to&mdash;and interact with&mdash;reenacted historical scenes.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Visitor uses a tablet for virtual tour of Notre-Dame.\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmU0MTQ5ODZmZmM1LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTYzY2RlNDU2MzBlZDg3NDE5NDJlNzc4YjJlMWUzY2Jj\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Using a HistoPad, visitors to the exhibit can travel back in time during their self-guided tour.

Histovery developed its digital tools based on Autodesk&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/3ds-max\/overview\" target=\"_blank\">3ds Max<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/maya\/overview\" target=\"_blank\">Maya<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Such tools make it possible to explain more complex elements, and since more details can be included, the visual product can provide even more information,&rdquo; Lussan says.<\/p>\n\n<h2>21 Historic Scenes Re-created by 12 Artists<\/h2>\n\n<p>These digital technologies and the expertise of the 12 artists working from its studios make it possible for Histovery to offer a unique view of Notre-Dame de Paris. The exhibit offers unprecedented access to a wealth of architectural details, historical anecdotes, and scientific realities that the general public was previously unaware of. This was achieved by combining <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/future-of-virtual-reality\">virtual reality<\/a> (VR) with the accuracy of contemporary scientific knowledge and by collaborating with the public institution responsible for Notre-Dame de Paris&rsquo;s conservation and restoration.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Experience Emperor Napoleon\u2019s coronation as captured by painter Jacques-Louis David.\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmU0MTYyM2IyNmExLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTk3N2Q4NjdjZjZmYTNmYjQ0YmQyYjIyNTQ4NDU2NDE3\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Experience Emperor Napoleon&rsquo;s coronation as captured by painter Jacques-Louis David.

This is Notre-Dame Cathedral as it has never been seen before. The HistoPad provides the public with quick access to information, offering an intuitive interface that lends itself to cultural mediation by encouraging the visitor to be more inquisitive. The &ldquo;Augmented Tour&rdquo; allows visitors to interact with the exhibit at their own pace, as they play their way through a rich graphic universe reminiscent of a video game.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;In <a href=\"https:\/\/notredameexpo.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\">&lsquo;Notre-Dame de Paris, the Experience&rsquo;<\/a>, we keep up with the latest developments from the construction site, updating content in between exhibits,&rdquo; de Sa Moreira says.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Recreating the 21 scenes in the \u201cNotre-Dame de Paris, the Experience\u201d exhibit took Histovery teams more than a year.\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmU0MTc1MjBhZTNkLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWFjNmM0MjIwMDc1M2Y3ZjJkZmEwNjJkMDFlNTBjMGVi\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Re-creating the 21 scenes in the &ldquo;Notre-Dame de Paris, the Experience&rdquo; exhibit took Histovery teams more than a year.

Autodesk is also involved in rebuilding the Notre-Dame de Paris through the support it provided to the public institution responsible for the conservation and restoration of the cathedral. Autodesk&rsquo;s AEC Collection, along with BIM 360, were used to create a digital model of the cathedral and the immediate vicinity. These technologies have accelerated rebuilding of the edifice&mdash;and their effectiveness has already <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/architectural-preservation\" target=\"_blank\">been proven<\/a> in other cathedrals across France and around the world.<\/p>\n\n<p>By exploring the phases of restoration in a way that demonstrates their diversity and complexity, &ldquo;Notre Dame de Paris, the Experience&rdquo; also sheds light on centuries-old expertise in the artistic trades. The generally unseen and perhaps underappreciated work of stonemasons, stone cutters, master glassmakers, and other conservator-restorers has been placed in the spotlight. This extraordinary exhibit increases the visibility of these trades, turning them into a living heritage that&mdash;like the cathedral&mdash;can be appreciated by all.<\/p>\n<\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n"},

That&rsquo;s a massive incentive for the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry to improve productivity and speed up project delivery. Construction is ripe for disruption, and two of the technologies playing a central role in its transformation are <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/bim-building-information-modeling\">building information modeling (BIM)<\/a> and geographic information systems (GIS).<\/p>\n\n<p>Evidence has been mounting for years that BIM-driven 3D modeling and data visualization are essential for major urban construction projects. Yet before the pandemic, the World Economic Forum estimated that <a href=\"https:\/\/www3.weforum.org\/docs\/WEF_Accelerating_BIM_Adoption_Action_Plan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">only about a third<\/a>&nbsp;(PDF, p. 4) of infrastructure and public works firms had fully integrated BIM tools into their operating models.<\/p>\n\n<p>The rest are missing out on better collaboration between project partners, cost and resource savings, shorter project lifecycles, improved building management, and safer construction sites.<\/p>\n\n<p>Today, clients are in the driver&rsquo;s seat, demanding an integrated full-lifecycle approach for those projects with BIM and GIS as the digital hubs for design, construction, project management, collaboration, and operation.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"The first-phase development of the Kwun Tung North and Fanling North development areas\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzBlYTY5Nzg5YmU4LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWIwMTVmNTk2YTQ1MzRhZWJlOGY5NjM0ZjYxNzJlZmQx\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The first-phase development of the Kwun Tung North and Fanling North development areas.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Talking the Same Language<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>In Hong Kong&rsquo;s push to become the world&rsquo;s preeminent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartcity.gov.hk\/\" target=\"_blank\">smart city<\/a>, government departments responsible for roadworks, water services, maintenance, and power distribution began using BIM technology back in 2016. However, individual departments applied the tech independently, establishing their own data standards and creating separate object libraries for their stand-alone applications.<\/p>\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, this disconnection limited the value BIM could deliver. Infrastructure projects require all relevant city agencies to work together, but lack of common data standards meant disparate systems couldn&rsquo;t talk to each other. BIM was delivering at the departmental level, but the wider benefits of information sharing with clients and digital collaboration between project stakeholders remained out of reach.<\/p>\n\n<p>To eliminate those barriers, Hong Kong&rsquo;s Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) launched a multiyear initiative to establish a single, harmonized BIM data standard that every agency involved in public works in Hong Kong would have to abide by.<\/p>\n\n<p>Called Horizontal Harmonization for BIM\/GIS Integration, the project is replacing in-house data siloes and a patchwork of different BIM approaches that have built up over years with a single shared platform. Integrating BIM and GIS allows users to visualize a digitally designed project in the context of its geographic location, thus reducing the risks and uncertainties associated with complex infrastructure projects.<\/p>\n\n<p>The program falls under the First Phase development of the Kwun Tung North and Fanling North New Development Areas in Hong Kong. Infrastructure is being built to address the city&rsquo;s long-term housing demand and provide employment opportunities as part of the Hong Kong 2030: Planning Vision and Strategy program.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;To showcase the value, we had to show that it was possible for every spatial data object in Hong Kong&rsquo;s library of public works projects to be housed under one BIM standard,&rdquo; says Thomson Lai, Asia digital leader at global engineering company AECOM, which led the project. &ldquo;We then had to create a standard for exchanging BIM data from [Autodesk] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/revit\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">Revit<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/civil-3d\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">Civil 3D<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buildingsmart.org\/standards\/bsi-standards\/industry-foundation-classes\/\" target=\"_blank\">IFC<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ogc.org\/standards\/citygml\" target=\"_blank\">CityGML<\/a>.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"common data environment is mapped with the elements in the 3D visualization platform of the BIM data repository\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzBlYTdmZjg5YWVmLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTA2ZWM3NTYwMzY4NjAxMGMwODRhMTk2YWU0OGM5ZWI3\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The common data environment is mapped with the elements in the 3D visualization platform of the BIM data repository.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>Key stakeholders include Hong Kong&rsquo;s Development Bureau (DEVB); Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD); Lands Department (LandsD); Other Works Department, which oversees all public works projects in the city state; and the Hong Kong Lands Department, which manages all of Hong Kong&rsquo;s land matters and territory-wide 2D and 3D maps.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Lands Department played a key role. As the body responsible for mapping Hong Kong&rsquo;s landholding and the major provider of spatial data provider for Hong Kong, the agency is the only source of the 1:1,000-or-smaller-scale topographical maps that designers, engineers, and construction contractors rely on to make projects happen. In the past, it created 2D maps for paper output or basic digital display, but today it&rsquo;s increasingly called on to generate 3D data visualizations to accommodate digital project management.<\/p>\n\n<p>That made the project&rsquo;s third objective&mdash;a single repository for all BIM data managed by the Lands Department&mdash;mission-critical. &ldquo;An IT infrastructure product to house all BIM data is the final project deliverable,&rdquo; Lai says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s being hosted in the Hong Kong Government Cloud Infrastructure Services [GCIS]. It will be the digital platform for all government infrastructure projects in the future, allowing every stakeholder to create BIM models to the same standard and share them as needed.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Triggers for Change<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Of all the drivers behind Hong Kong&rsquo;s BIM data harmonization initiative, eliminating complexity topped the list.<\/p>\n\n<p>Managing any infrastructure project is a balancing act to meet the requirements of multiple stakeholders: project owners, government departments, regulators, designers, engineers, consultants, the lead construction contractor, and subcontractors handling specialist tasks.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"The development of the conversion engine and the BIM data repository generate data in open formats that allow exchange of information between software applications, maintaining the model\u2019s integrity with minimal data loss\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzBlYThjNDYwOGM0LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTAwODE3OTM5NTZlMDlmZjA1ZjZiZDY0MTI1YmMzNTRl\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The development of the conversion engine and the BIM data repository generate data in open formats that allow exchange of information between software applications, maintaining the model&rsquo;s integrity with minimal data loss.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>Advancing a public works project in Hong Kong is a complex undertaking. Belowground dependencies include extensive utilities infrastructure. Aboveground, navigating zoning rules for the city&rsquo;s public markets comes into play, along with the demands of the Special Administrative Region&rsquo;s 250 islands and densely populated built environment.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;When design and construction firms enter into a project, they need to find ways to work together and navigate a complicated project and regulatory environment,&rdquo; Lai says. &ldquo;BIM was offering a way to cut through it, but without an agreed-upon data standard, you had the challenge of deciding whose standard to follow. Now we have one version of the truth.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Seamless Handovers<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>With the harmonization project concluding in April 2022 and the BIM standard and data repository now in rollout, Hong Kong&rsquo;s infrastructure agencies are already seeing significant benefits.<\/p>\n\n<p>A major plus is that using common data platforms has sped up the handover of building information to the client&mdash;which also increases the business value of the data.<\/p>\n\n<p>The use of BIM and GIS introduces a spatial element to this innovative smart cities project with a clear goal in mind: to increase the efficiency of the entire design and construction process.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;In the old days, much of the information at handover was useless to the asset owner,&rdquo; Lai says. &ldquo;If they wanted to take advantage of the data for analytics or build their own 3D model, they had to start from scratch due to incompatible data standards and formats. Now, all a client needs to do is upload the building data into the new BIM data repository using Autodesk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/vault\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">Vault Professional<\/a>. The conversion engine we&rsquo;ve built for bring the native format to open IFC and open GIS formats.&rdquo;<\/p>"},

Or perhaps it&rsquo;s a vision of the Rube Goldberg&ndash;esque machines of Willy Wonka&rsquo;s colorful chocolate factory that produce an endless amount of sweets. Whatever image you conjure, the benefits of automation in manufacturing are universal: greater efficiency, higher productivity, and humans performing value-add tasks for better business outcomes.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-automation-mfg\"><strong>What Is Automation in Manufacturing Industries?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Automation in manufacturing industries is the use of machines and software to automate production and business processes in a manufacturing operation. The purpose of automation is to hand over dirty, dangerous, or dull tasks to technology. Automation is not about eliminating people; instead, it eliminates repetitive tasks and shifts human brainpower over to more creative, high-value-added tasks that lead to business growth.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"person looking at hologram factory data\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzEyM2I2MWFjZGIyLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTU0MGQwNzBiNzk0MDIwYmE5YzdkN2M1ODExNmM5NzQ3\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Automation handles repetitive jobs, freeing workers up for more creative, high-value tasks.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>Although automation might happen in stages, the ultimate goal is to automate and improve the entire operation, creating a continuous journey of information that travels from engineering all the way to postproduction and maintenance&mdash;and eventually back to design. This connected data improves and optimizes the entire process of turning a virtual design into a physical product ready to ship to your customer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Automation in manufacturing is not just robots on an assembly line handling mechanical processes, though that is part of it. Companies automate production and processes in order to:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Eliminate silos, empower the information flow, and connect everyone<\/li>\n\t<li>Increase throughput and, with that, increase return of capital employed (ROCE)<\/li>\n\t<li>Eliminate downtime<\/li>\n\t<li>Reduce errors and rework<\/li>\n\t<li>Free up humans for value-add and creative tasks<\/li>\n\t<li>Create a closed data loop for full visibility and feedback<\/li>\n\t<li>Be more agile<\/li>\n\t<li>Enable mass customization<\/li>\n\t<li>Support lean operations<\/li>\n\t<li>Save money and&nbsp;reduce unit costs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"history\"><strong>A Brief History of Automation in Manufacturing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Ever since humans have been on the scene, they&rsquo;ve been inventing ways to hand over physical labor to machines for faster, more efficient work. Case in point: the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Water_wheel\" target=\"_blank\">water wheel<\/a>. Some highlights of the automation-in-manufacturing timeline include:<\/p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Industrial Revolution<\/strong> in the 18th and 19th centuries introduced new power sources, such as coal, oil, gas, and steam. Also, new high-tech (for then) equipment emerged, such as the steam engine, the spinning jenny, and the sewing machine.<\/p>\n\n<p>In 1913, <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/videos\/henry-fords-manufacturing-innovations\">Henry Ford<\/a> introduced the <strong>assembly line<\/strong> to the automotive industry (an idea he got from visiting the efficient workflow of a meat-processing plant) and a moving conveyor belt that brought cars to the workers at each station instead of the other way around. Suddenly, it took only <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.ford.com\/articles\/history\/moving-assembly-line.html\" target=\"_blank\">90 minutes<\/a> to build a car instead of 12 hours.<\/p>\n\n<p>Manufacturers were reluctant at first to <strong>switch from <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-40673694\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>steam<\/strong><\/a><strong> to electric motors<\/strong> to power their factories in the early 1900s, but once they did, they were more productive. By the 1920s, manufacturers had increased output by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.progressiveautomations.com\/blogs\/news\/the-evolution-of-automation\" target=\"_blank\">30%<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the 1950s and &rsquo;60s, automation replaced so many workers in the United States that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kalevleetaru\/2019\/07\/18\/automation-reshaped-the-workplace-in-the-1960s-but-will-the-deep-learning-revolution-be-different\/?sh=7fc93943702f\" target=\"_blank\">government slogan<\/a>&nbsp;was, &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get tomorrow&rsquo;s jobs with yesterday&rsquo;s skills.&rdquo; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crf-usa.org\/images\/pdf\/automation-american-worker.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Robots<\/strong><\/a><strong>&nbsp;(PDF, p. 1) entered the factory and <\/strong><strong>electronic data processing<\/strong><strong> (<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2016\/02\/todays-automation-anxiety-was-alive-and-well-in-1960\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>EDP<\/strong><\/a><strong>) emerged<\/strong>&nbsp;and began to automate business processes and information management.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the past, automation was something you could predict. You set up a mechanical process that followed sequential steps and ended up with the same result. Then, a crazy thing happened: Customers started to have a say. They wanted to customize their cars and choose their own color. (Ford famously said customers can order the car in any color as long as it was black.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Automation has come a long way, and humans are an integral part of the equation, despite long-held fears that they would be replaced completely. Cars are customized by order and companies can build different models on the same line thanks to flexible manufacturing and automation. (Even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/fords-smarter-robots-speeding-assembly-line\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ford<\/a> now uses robots and artificial intelligence [AI].) Changes are happening fast, and companies need to be much more agile to be able to react quickly, enable mass customization, and adapt to shifting supply chains. But unlocked potential remains&mdash;moving forward, automation will be centered around data.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"people hovered around computers screens looking at data\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzEyM2M2ZTVmNjkxLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWY0NjUzZjc4YmFkMTM3YjFkNmYwNTI3YzVjM2Q0ODBi\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">In the future, automation will be centered around data.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"benefits\"><strong>Benefits of Automation in Manufacturing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>The more a manufacturing operation hands the reins to machines and software, the more it realizes the benefits of automation in manufacturing. Some of these benefits include:<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Unlocking People Capacity<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Humans are the greatest asset of your operation. Automating mundane tasks allows you to pivot workers to more creative, high-value-add tasks. Unlocking that capacity means more innovation power as humans move to new roles, becoming <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shrm.org\/executive\/resources\/articles\/pages\/humanoid-robot-pepper-fired.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">data scientists<\/a>, developers, and engineers.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Connecting Data<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>When silos are eliminated, what&rsquo;s left is a river of connected data streamlining the entire manufacturing process and supply chain. With centralized information, there&rsquo;s knowledge continuity. People no longer need to search through paper records and folders to get the information they need, wasting time and money.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Delivering a Consistent Quality of Product<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Machines and technology are programmed to perform repeatable tasks, and they do it much more consistently than their human counterparts. Machines don&rsquo;t suffer from boredom or fatigue. They make fewer, if any, errors. This reliability and predictability support compliance and deliver a known product to customers.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Supporting Lean Manufacturing<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Automation streamlines workflows for less rework and less wasted material, creating a leaner operation.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Decreasing Downtime<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Machines can run around the clock, unlike their human counterparts who need breaks, food, and to go home at the end of the day. Automation also enables predictive maintenance, which reduces the risk of disruptions from equipment failures.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Increasing Safety<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Manufacturing has long been a dangerous job for production workers. With automation, robots and machines handle more of the hazardous production tasks, reducing accident rates.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Creating a Solution to the Labor Shortage<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>As manufacturing faces an ongoing labor shortage due to an aging and retiring workforce and lack of incoming workers, accelerating automation to handle those vacant production jobs can take the pressure off while companies recruit talent for the higher-skilled jobs needed.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Optimizing the Operation Continually<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Automation generates heaps of insights that enable humans to make data-driven decisions to optimize operations. Technology can also improve processes. <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/data-driven-decision-making2\">Forty-two percent<\/a> of organizations worldwide are putting money toward AI and machine learning, which allows computers to harness their own power to recognize patterns and constantly improve their own performance.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Enabling Compliance and Lowering Risk<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Automating business processes with industry-specific software can ensure compliance with manufacturing regulatory agencies.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Improving Agility<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Companies that automate their manufacturing processes are more responsive to customer and market demands, more flexible in the face of disruption, and more resilient.<\/p>\n\n<p>The sum of all of these benefits? Greater productivity and efficiency, a more competitive standing in the marketplace, and a better bottom line.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"closed-loop\"><strong>Creating a Closed-Loop Data Flow From Start to Finish<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Historically, manufacturing has been a linear process: ideate, build, sell. Information is siloed and disconnected and dead ends when the product is shipped. Any disruption along the way halts production, requires human intervention, and often leads to wasteful rework. Think of the classic scenario of the old newspaper printing press: If one component didn&rsquo;t perform well, the whole run was ruined.<\/p>\n\n<p>A first-tier goal of automation is to bend that horizontal workflow into a closed loop where data is connected and moves continuously from design to engineering to production to the customer and back to design. All of the data that machines and software generate is centralized instead of siloed and accessible across disciplines. But the real defining element of <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/manufacturing-automation\">closed-loop manufacturing<\/a> is feedback: At the end of production, information can travel upstream to inform and improve the next cycle and the quality of the finished product for a self-optimizing workflow.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"people in an office looking at data on computer screens\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzEyM2QyY2JlNjZjLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTVhODUwOGQyZGE2NzUwZmNhYjA4NDc5MjY0NjM0Y2Q4\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Closed-loop feedback connects manufacturers with suppliers and other stakeholders in the supply chain.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>The benefits of creating a closed-loop data flow include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Deeper, actionable insights<\/li>\n\t<li>Cross-functional collaboration<\/li>\n\t<li>Constant learning and improvement<\/li>\n\t<li>Mass customization<\/li>\n\t<li>The ability to change production based on market requirements<\/li>\n\t<li>Better competitiveness, responsiveness, and agility<\/li>\n\t<li>Less waste<\/li>\n\t<li>Better products<\/li>\n\t<li>Shorter run times<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Closed-loop feedback starts internally but can extend beyond the walls of the manufacturing facility, looping in suppliers so engineers can source materials and check pricing to make the best decisions. That connectivity can go all the way down the value chain from design to delivery. A closed-loop operation consolidates information so everybody has the same view and access to continually updated information when they need it.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Bringing Together Multiple Data Sources<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Automation generates volumes of data from multiple sources, and that data is most powerful when it&rsquo;s connected and open. When businesses connect, standardize, and automate their systems, they converge those multiple data sources. That leads to enterprise-wide alignment and creates consistency. Different people, different disciplines, and different systems are in sync, communicating and collaborating from a single source of information that is constantly updated for uninterrupted lifecycles throughout the operation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are five lifecycles that benefit from a closed-loop system. They all need to come together to harness the power of automation and achieve operational excellence.<\/p>\n\n<h4><strong>1. Business Process Automation<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p>Automation in manufacturing is much more than programming robots to build things. It also includes streamlining the behind-the-scenes workflows of running a company. From purchase orders to HR functions, business process automation shifts manual functions to software, which frees up capacity, increases efficiency, and creates consistency. Think: HR automates payroll and scheduling to focus on recruiting and retention.<\/p>\n\n<p>The benefits of business process automation include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Connecting different systems for faster throughput of a particular process<\/li>\n\t<li>Consolidating data so multiple people can work off of the same information<\/li>\n\t<li>Automatically providing deliverables so the next-in-line process can continue working on the task.<\/li>\n\t<li>Identifying duplicate work to reduce waste and eliminate cost overruns<\/li>\n\t<li>Better inventory management that supports just-in-time manufacturing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h4><strong>2. Product Lifecycle Management<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p>Designing, building, and distributing a product was once a siloed, stop-start process with difficulty handing a project off from design to make. But with automation, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/solutions\/plm\">product lifecycle management<\/a> is a continuous journey with data seamlessly handed off from one discipline to the next. Centralized data enables enterprise-wide collaboration for everyone contributing to the different stages of the product lifecycle&mdash;from design and engineering to manufacturing and distribution&mdash;and accelerates time to market.<\/p>\n\n<h4><strong>3. Product Data Management<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p>Product data management (PDM) automates the design and engineering process and keeps everyone working from a central source of organized data. Software, like Autodesk&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/vault\/overview\">Vault<\/a>, increases collaboration across engineering, manufacturing, and extended teams. It tracks designs and revisions and enables collaboration between internal and external teams for smoother, faster workflows.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, if an engineer develops a 3D model of a product, there is a tremendous amount of information in that data set. That typically gets lost during the transition from engineering to manufacturing into production and maintenance. Product data management facilitates the reuse of that information instead of re-creating it over and over, which is a big first step of automation.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"person looking at product design image on computer screen\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzEyM2UyY2MzZmYxLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWZjZWQzNTYyYTAzZWYyMTY5ZGMwMGY3YWI3NTA0YmQz\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Centralized data allows collaboration at every stage of a product&rsquo;s lifestyle, from design to distribution.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h4><strong>4. Customer Lifecycle Management<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p>Just like data has the power to optimize internal operations, it can do the same for the customer journey. Leveraging data at each stage of the customer lifecycle&mdash;from reach to retention&mdash;enables a customized, deliberate interaction at every touchpoint. Having a digital communication channel that collects data helps you see where the customer is in the buying process, own the customer interface, and create customer intimacy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Digital channels of communication (a chat feature or self-service portal, for example) enable you to handle 100 different inquiries from 100 different customers and create intimacy with each one. This automation lets you personalize the customer lifecycle, create a frictionless experience, build loyalty, and stimulate growth. And after the pandemic, <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/five-trends-that-will-shape-manufacturing-in-20212\">customer experience<\/a> has become a priority for the manufacturing industry.<\/p>\n\n<h4><strong>5. Technology Lifecycle Management<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p>As you automate your manufacturing facility and processes, it&rsquo;s critical to create a roadmap for the lifecycle of the hardware and software you&rsquo;re investing in. In other words: technology lifecycle management, which means from asset acquisition to asset disposal.<\/p>\n\n<p>For asset acquisition, it&rsquo;s important to look at what you make, who you&rsquo;re making it for, and the materials you use to determine the best technology for your operation. For example, if you&rsquo;re building sports cars, you might work with carbon fiber because it&rsquo;s strong yet lightweight. But if you&rsquo;re building consumer cars, you&rsquo;ll most likely be working with steel and aluminum. Different technologies are appropriate for different customers and different designs. For an informed decision, ask questions like:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>What technology will put you in the best position to be a competitive player in your market?<\/li>\n\t<li>What equipment do you need to handle the materials you&rsquo;re working with? If regulations change and you need to swap out materials for sustainability reasons, can your technology handle a switch of design, production methods, or suppliers?<\/li>\n\t<li>What are your plans for upgrading and disposing of older technology as new technology becomes available?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>In an automated, closed-loop operation, you have greater visibility into the functionality of your technology infrastructure and insight into how to best manage its lifecycle.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"challenges\"><strong>3 Challenges of Automation in Manufacturing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>While there are many benefits of automation in manufacturing, there are a few challenges and trade-offs companies should anticipate.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>1. Economic Feasibility<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Automation in manufacturing is a case-by-case decision. Companies need to weigh the pros and cons to assess if it&rsquo;s economically feasible based on their specific needs, even if it technically makes sense to automate. For example, a manufacturer in a country with lower labor costs might not jump at the chance to lay out a big investment in new technology and machines. But if labor costs increase and you&rsquo;re forced to outsource, at a certain point, you need to automate to keep work in your country.<\/p>\n\n<p>Companies also need to take easily disrupted supply chains into account. It doesn&rsquo;t help if you have cheap labor if your ship is stuck in a harbor in another part of the world. Manufacturers need to think about how to balance on-shoring, near-shoring, and cost of labor to determine if and when automation is needed.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>2. Logistics<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>The nuts and bolts of automating an operation can create logistical challenges that require proper planning to avoid. If the effort is too big, companies will shy away from it. First, there will be a disruption as you automate each process, because you can&rsquo;t change the wheels while you&rsquo;re flying. You have to figure out a few things like:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>How do I connect the different data flows?<\/li>\n\t<li>How do I connect the different projects and products?<\/li>\n\t<li>How do I standardize the data exchange between the different systems and disciplines?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Automation also generates dependency, which is part of the beauty of it; the open flow of information between connected machines and programs creates a high-functioning manufacturing ecosystem. But when tasks depend on each other, one small break in the process can lead to a system-wide failure.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>3. Reorganization<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>While automation will have your production line humming along faster and more efficiently than ever, it also means humans will be displaced, and you&rsquo;ll need to restructure your workforce into more cognitive areas. You&rsquo;ll need to hire skilled workers or invest in <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/e-books\/workforce-upskilling\">upskilling<\/a> your current workforce.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the upsides of automation is that workplace technology holds an appeal for many job seekers looking for more digitally progressive employers. But finding top talent can be difficult in today&rsquo;s labor market&mdash;in fact, there could be as many as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nam.org\/2-1-million-manufacturing-jobs-could-go-unfilled-by-2030-13743\/\">2.1 million<\/a> unfilled manufacturing positions by 2030. Reorganizing and upskilling your current workforce will be necessary investments for successful automation.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"person looking at designs and data on computer\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzEyM2VmYzY2MTQ2LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTFkYzJhZjAzM2EzYTE4N2I3NmRhNWVlYWI5M2FiMDMx\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">When automating facilities and process, it&rsquo;s important to build a roadmap for the lifecycle of new hardware and software systems.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"examples\"><strong>Examples of How Automation Is Used in Manufacturing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>The principles of automation are steadfast, but the application of those principles varies by industry and by company, depending on specific needs. Here are some examples of automation in manufacturing.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>GEA Automates for Custom Machines<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Founded in 1881, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/customer-stories\/gea\">GEA<\/a>&nbsp; is one of the world&rsquo;s leading producers of equipment, systems, and processing solutions for manufacturers, particularly in the food and beverage industry. Although the company offers a line of standard products, it also custom designs equipment. Each order might be unique to a customer&rsquo;s needs, but the primary components&mdash;like the compressors, pumps, and valves&mdash;are the same on each unit. To create and customize configurations using standard components, GEA uses Autodesk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/inventor\/overview\">Inventor<\/a> to automate the design of custom machines and Vault to automate engineering tasks and deliverables. The company has reduced engineering time by up to 80% and can create new designs in hours instead of weeks.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>ANDRITZ Cuts Errors With Automated Data Management<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/digital-manufacturing\">ANDRITZ<\/a> is an Austrian manufacturer of paper mill equipment. But the company was buried under mountains of paper until it digitalized its planning and design process. With automated business processes, ANDRITZ has streamlined workflows and made information, data, and designs equally accessible across the value chain by using Autodesk <a href=\"https:\/\/forge.autodesk.com\/\">Forge<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/bim-360\/\">BIM 360<\/a>, and Vault. Automating data management has reduced errors that are common with manual data recording and connected the company directly with its suppliers.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>VisiConsult Customizes X-Rays<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/customer-stories\/digital-transformation\/visiconsult\">VisiConsult<\/a> manufactures industrial x-ray machines primarily for the aviation industry, but its customer base is ever-expanding, and the company often gets orders for custom x-ray equipment for a variety of industries. To create a seamless design-build process, VisiConsult leverages automation with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/fusion-360-manage\/overview\">Fusion 360 Manage<\/a> and Fusion Lifecycle to engage with customers and automates product lifecycle management, testing and simulating designs virtually before any raw material is used.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"future\"><strong>What Is the Future of Automation in Manufacturing?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>The reality of the future is that the global population is steadily growing and expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, and demand for goods is increasing along with it. That means manufacturers must meet this demand by producing things better and faster. But at the same time, supply chains are weak, resources are scarce, and the labor pool is shrinking.<\/p>\n\n<p>While automation isn&rsquo;t a fix-all as it is now, the <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/future-of-automation\">future of automation<\/a> in manufacturing will help rectify these imbalances. But despite all of the bells and whistles that technology will bring, the core purpose of automation will remain the same: to handle repetitive tasks, harness the power of data, and unlock human potential to focus on value-add tasks like product innovation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a glimpse into the future of automation.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"robotic arms welding\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzEyNDAxY2FjZTQ5LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTYxMWMzZGE4M2M2MzVhNjQ3OWU4ODIxNzM0NGM1MDM1\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Robotic process-automation software learns human actions and then mimics and automates those tasks.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h3><strong>Intelligent Automation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>As systems become more connected and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution\" target=\"_blank\">Industry 4.0<\/a> becomes the norm, automation is going to kick manufacturing into high gear. In the current configuration, machines are good at handling repetitive and known tasks. In the future, greater machine-learning capabilities will enable a more autonomous operation capable of anticipating unforeseen events and correcting course preemptively.<\/p>\n\n<p>With this, the industry will move toward intelligent automation. That will lead to what&rsquo;s been coined as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/information-technology\/glossary\/hyperautomation\" target=\"_blank\">hyperautomation<\/a>, where every business process that can be automated <em>is<\/em> automated, thanks to advanced software and technologies. This will usher in a more autonomous factory that can observe, analyze, and improve using the following elements:<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Artificial Intelligence<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>AI will continue to expand its reach and <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/ai-in-manufacturing\">take automation to the next level<\/a>. With real-time data monitoring, AI can autocorrect and optimize an operation. In manufacturing, AI-powered <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/what-is-generative-design\">generative design<\/a> will handle more of the product development. A computer will take basic configurations and explore different design possibilities, beyond what the human brain could conceive of, to reach the best possible solution.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Machine Learning<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Computers are programmed to perform actions. In the future, they&rsquo;ll be able to analyze their own data and figure out what they need to do to maximize performance. There are hints of this now, like with predictive maintenance. Equipment failures are one of the biggest disruptions to the manufacturing process and can cost a manufacturer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.automation.com\/en-us\/articles\/june-2021\/world-largest-manufacturers-lose-almost-1-trillion\" target=\"_blank\">$532,000 an hour<\/a>. Predictive maintenance tries to curb those failures and downtime, but it hasn&rsquo;t had the automated setting to reach its full potential. As factories become smarter, <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/videos\/machine-learning-robotics\">machine learning<\/a> will grow stronger as sensors everywhere collect data to optimize the factory.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Robotic Process Automation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Robotic process automation (RPA) is software that will be able to monitor and track human actions and mimic and automate those same tasks.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzEyNjExODgyZTUwLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTFiNzJjMzU1ZjA1YTRlYjlmZjY3Y2RjZDc4NWY0N2Ey\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Automation involves restructuring work teams and reskilling employees.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h3><strong>Humans in the Future of Manufacturing<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s no question that the role of humans is changing as automation accelerates. More and more, workers are transitioning to jobs away from the production floor and into more cognitive realms. The workers in the future will handle the creative orchestration of the automated facility, with all its complexity and flexibility. But despite being further from the action, people will still be a key part of intelligent automation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some think the future of automation in manufacturing is a lights-out facility, where machines and software operate the entire process without the presence of humans. And there are indeed instances where autonomous vehicles and robots seem to be in charge. But in reality, it will be a combination of highly intelligent automation: so-called <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/the-future-of-work\">cobots<\/a>, robots that work together with human workers in a highly flexible production environment. Instead of handing tasks over, this cohort works with technical systems in new ways that will take manufacturing to a new level of production and efficiency&mdash;and, at the risk of sounding dramatic, will change the world.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong>Platforms<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>So now you have this fully automated, intelligent factory that&rsquo;s buzzing with data. But where does all this data live? The next big step is going to be around platforms. Cloud-based <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/platform-economy\">platforms<\/a> will be connected ecosystems hosting all of the data that automation generates. It will connect systems, people, and processes to make information flow better between different disciplines and tools. Platforms will level up automation to the next technical capabilities.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"data-driven\"><strong>Automation in Manufacturing: A Data-Driven Future<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Automation has come a long way from a conveyor belt moving cars around a factory. Automation in manufacturing has become more granular, focusing on the power of what data can do. It&rsquo;s creating greater visibility and delivering deeper insights than ever before. As automation accelerates, companies will be able to make data-driven decisions that propel them to a more competitive standing and a more innovative, resilient future.<\/p>"},

A number of cameras hang from the ceiling, and a massive screen illuminates the room. While discussing the challenges of digitalization in the construction industry, Kessoudis takes out a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ellementry.com\/blog\/why-your-teabags-need-a-trendy-tea-box\" target=\"_blank\">compartmentalized box<\/a> full of tea bags, a common household item in Austria and Germany.<\/p><p>&ldquo;The tea box is the building,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The tea bags are the standardized components that are installed in the building.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Kessoudis does, however, note that a tea box is less flexible than buildings. &ldquo;While tea boxes are preconfigured, structures of buildings vary in size and shape,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Ideally, you&rsquo;d be able to sort everything out during the design stage: organize the tea bags individually, arrange them in any box independent of structure, and network these boxes with the production system.&rdquo;<\/p><p>STRABAG&rsquo;s tea-box system uses standardized components that are connected to manufacturing processes, and Kessoudis believes that the mechanical engineers who have been working with this system since the 1990s are far more efficient than construction workers. He cites <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/modern-factory-\">integrated factory modeling in the automotive industry<\/a> as a prime example of this efficiency and says the construction sector has some catching up to do.<\/p><p>&ldquo;This connection between planning elements and the production process is precisely what we&rsquo;re missing on the building site,&rdquo; Kessoudis says. But change is no longer optional for the construction sector, whose raw material procurement, building processes, and operations are responsible for almost 40% of global carbon dioxide emissions&nbsp;and is adopting leaner processes as a result. STRABAG&rsquo;s new system is a huge step in the right direction.<\/p><h2>Automation and Networking Are Key to Modern Construction<\/h2><p>Kessoudis is excited about the topics of automation and networking. &ldquo;Networking reduces inefficiencies such as having to search for items on the construction site,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Automation helps us to become both more competitive and more sustainable.&rdquo; He is not only talking about connecting design and construction but also about reducing the number of materials and the need for strenuous physical labor on the construction site by using robotics, 3D concrete printing, virtual-reality goggles, and artificial intelligence (AI) in the design and construction phases.<\/p><figure><img alt=\"people working in hardhats at strabag\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzIxMTM2MTY4MjczLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWZhNzZhNzE2N2UyZTEzZWYwZWE3ZDhlN2VkNzE3Mzkw\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Automation helps construction companies become more competitive and more sustainable, which is why STRABAG focuses on innovations such as augmented reality and generative design.

Generative design is one of many innovation drivers and is now the name of a dedicated STRABAG unit that reports to Dr. Marco Xaver Bornschlegl as part of STRABAG Innovation &amp; Digitalization. Function Lead for Generative Design Fabian Evers also mentions automation regularly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re rethinking the design stage,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all about automated processes. We translate expertise in architecture and construction into algorithms to automate design. Ultimately, automated design lets us optimize buildings.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Designers used to work on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet; now, they use an automation tool. All the designer has to do is set the parameters and define the objectives. These are then fed into a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/solutions\/cad-design\">CAD system<\/a>. The computer takes this as the basis for logical calculations using adaptive AI&nbsp;methods to create not three or four, but myriad optimal designs in a very short time. These designs also contain a far greater number of more precise metrics than any human designer could ever provide. All the designer has to do is decide on the best solution by filtering according to certain parameters.<\/p><p>This design method is being developed in collaboration with <a href=\"https:\/\/innovation.strabag.com\/en\/project\/ideas-at-the-touch-of-a-button\/\" target=\"_blank\">STRABAG Real Estate<\/a> (SRE) for land valuation, for example. Project developers can rapidly determine the best way to develop a site. The tools take into account parameters such as the optimal amount of direct sunlight, the CO2 footprint, and the number of housing units right from the start.<\/p><figure><img alt=\"different iterations of the design using generative design\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzIxMTRkMzlkMzZhLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTIxODc5ZjMwN2VlN2YwODM4NDdiZjAwNWU4Njg0MjE5\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Generative design can be used to create different structures. This helps land valuation planners determine how best to develop a site. Courtesy of STRABAG.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Generative design is also used in detailed planning. It &ldquo;greatly simplifies the designers&rsquo; work,&rdquo; Evers says. His team has programmed standardized staircase and elevator modules that are automatically generated in Autodesk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/revit\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">Revit<\/a> once parameters such as the floor height are entered. This means that the designers do not have to redraw standard staircases every time they start a new construction project; instead, they can refer to the blueprint. This is a prime example of the &ldquo;standardized tea bag.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;The computer-generated stair module saves us a lot of time at the design stage,&rdquo; Evers says. &ldquo;Instead of three weeks of fiddling about, the design for a staircase can be completed in a single day.&rdquo; Designers no longer have to bother with modeling simple components. A variety of floor plans make it much easier to move walls, as the modules automatically adapt to changes to the model. This saves valuable time in responding to individual customer requests.<\/p><p>In the future, STRABAG and Z&Uuml;BLIN want to develop parts of buildings or even entire buildings as a &ldquo;tea box&rdquo; construction system based on the staircase model. The planning, production, and final assembly of these structures on the construction site will all be automated. All three stages will be seamless, digitized, and networked.<\/p><h2>Algorithms Connect Planners<\/h2><p>This method of working enables closer collaboration between designers who previously worked in silos. It brings architects, structural engineers, building services engineers, sustainability experts, fire protection officers, facade planners, and structural engineers to the same table; gives them a better understanding of interdependencies; and allows them to see the building as a whole. In short, generative design makes planning more networked.<\/p><p>One of the main benefits of this for the construction industry is sustainability. This new digital design method gives sustainability experts (who have traditionally had a say only at the end of the planning phase) a voice right from the start, as the tool takes the carbon footprint into account from the very beginning of a project.<\/p><figure><img alt=\"people in hardhats in a tunnel\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzIxMTU0OTk0OWM3LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTQ3ZjEwZTRkNWViMWQ3YTNiNWExNDQ4ZWZmOTFhMmJk\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Automation tools allow employees at STRABAG and Z&Uuml;BLIN to work in a more networked, efficient, and sustainable manner. Courtesy of STRABAG.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>&ldquo;This is a huge help in the move toward <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/sustainable-construction\">sustainable construction<\/a>,&rdquo; Evers says. He explains that design decisions are now based on facts and parameters whereas they used to be based exclusively on the experience of experts. Without the aid of generative design, a vinyl window would be installed in a certain way because &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s always been done&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s more economical in the short term. Now, however, the automation tool will suggest an aluminum window because it lasts longer and is more sustainable.<\/p><p>STRABAG believes that automation tools and generative design can revolutionize the planning and construction process. They accelerate pipelines; bring experts together; and save time, money, and resources. <em>Optimization<\/em> is the magic word, automation is the magic wand, and the tea box is the hat from which designers conjure up standardized components for production.<\/p>"},

I&rsquo;m not just talking about the global pandemic. Climate change, fractured supply chains, inflation, and labor shortages are shaking things up around the world.<\/p>\n\n<p>But although the word <em>disruption<\/em> has negative connotations, it also creates opportunities to do things in different ways. Disruption forces people to rethink, reimagine, and reinvent. Right now, digital transformation is accelerating, and exciting technologies are emerging. That&rsquo;s led to new ways of collaborating and spurred an age of innovation.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hbs.edu\/faculty\/Pages\/profile.aspx?facId=6479\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Linda A. Hill<\/a>, a professor at the Harvard Business School, certainly sees it this way. She has done extensive research on innovation, leadership, and digital transformation, and she knows exactly what helps digitally mature companies succeed. &ldquo;Innovation is not about solo genius; it&rsquo;s about collective genius,&rdquo; Dr. Hill said in her <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ImmtTHYU5GQ\" target=\"_blank\">TedxCambridge<\/a> talk. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a type of collaborative problem solving usually among people who have different expertise and different points of view.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>To thrive in today&rsquo;s world, organizations can harness that collective genius by moving to cloud-based platforms. The best platforms are open, collaborative environments that bring data, people, and processes together. They are the pinnacle of digital transformation, and they&rsquo;re on track to disrupt the status quo and change the world.<\/p>\n\n<p><iframe border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"103\" scroll=\"none\" src=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/hubsFront\/embed_cta\/484865\" width=\"250\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Why Cloud-Based Platforms? Why Now?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>For too long, collaboration has been hampered by closed tools that lock data into proprietary file formats. Different software programs couldn&rsquo;t communicate, workflows were disconnected, and people had to access massive files to search for the information they needed. These old ways of working don&rsquo;t apply anymore.<\/p>\n\n<p>On a platform, people, processes, and data are connected in an open ecosystem. Information can flow upstream and downstream for full visibility. Real-time workflows are automated and extensible. Data is granular, so people can access the exact information they need when they need it. Having a single, collaborative environment delivers greater value to stakeholders and builds resilience. And there&rsquo;s no greater story of resilience than the city of New Orleans.<\/p>\n\n<p>Meagen Williams, P.E., is the stormwater program manager for New Orleans, a place that has experienced disruption like nowhere else. This coastal city is particularly vulnerable to the stronger storms associated with climate change.<\/p>\n\n<p>Williams, who witnessed the devastation of Hurricane Katrina firsthand, is changing how things are done and applying data-informed, innovative ideas to this historic city. Her team is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uno.edu\/news\/2022-01-21\/alumna-meagan-williams-channels-civil-engineering-skills-manage-nolas-storm-waters\" target=\"_blank\">reducing flood risks<\/a> with <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bioswale\" target=\"_blank\">bioswales<\/a>, pervious ground layers, and stormwater parks. Her projects bring together multiple stakeholders&mdash;including city administrators, engineers, construction teams, and the public&mdash;and leverage historic data to design for a resilient future.<\/p>\n\n<p>Platforms, with end-to-end solutions built on a common data experience, are perfect places for such projects. They create a unified experience, lift people out of their silos, and deliver the right information to the right people at the right time. All of that happens in the cloud, far from the noise and chaos of disruption down below. At the rate things are going, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2021-11-10-gartner-says-cloud-will-be-the-centerpiece-of-new-digital-experiences\" target=\"_blank\">95%<\/a> of all work will take place on cloud-based platforms by 2025.<\/p>\n\n<p>Autodesk is keeping pace with this trend, empowering three key industries&mdash;manufacturing, media and entertainment, and AEC&mdash;to be more innovative, productive, and profitable by bringing everything together on industry clouds. The three industry clouds, along with a shared set of services (called Autodesk Platform Services, formerly Forge), make solutions more connected, extensible, and open.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"workers on a construction site\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzJhNGViOGE4ZDlkLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTgwODYzNmU2M2YxMWJlYjI5MmNlNDc1NzhiMzVhYzYy\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Managing architecture, engineering, and construction projects in the cloud keeps teams connected with shared data, which enables seamless collaboration and as little error as possible.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Connecting People and Data for Frictionless Workflows<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Connectivity has never been more important.

Now, that&rsquo;s leveled off at a new normal with <a href=\"https:\/\/news.gallup.com\/poll\/355907\/remote-work-persisting-trending-permanent.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">45%<\/a> of remote-capable jobs being performed out of the office at least part of the time (and 25% fully remote). This evolution of work requires a shift to a new paradigm. The cloud has become the new collaboration space, whether colleagues are in the office next door or on the other side of the world.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bas.ac.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">British Antarctic Survey<\/a> (BAS) polar research station, scientists study the global impacts of climate change. Their work requires incredibly sturdy infrastructure, especially in its extreme environment. BAS has invested &pound;300 million (about $354 million) to build a new research vessel and upgrade its wharf and facilities. The projects are complex and require careful coordination with stakeholders around the globe, led by engineering firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.baminternational.com\/en\/projects\/british-antarctic-survey\" target=\"_blank\">BAM International<\/a> in the Netherlands, Swedish architecture and construction consultancy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.swecogroup.com\/about-us\/\" target=\"_blank\">Sweco<\/a>, engineering firm <a href=\"https:\/\/ramboll.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ramb&oslash;ll<\/a> in Denmark, and the team in Antarctica.<\/p>\n\n<p>With much of the prefabrication happening in the UK, the teams must get everything ready for the small window of time they have for on-site construction between October and March. The schedule is tight, and there&rsquo;s no room for error or missing parts. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re managing this project on the cloud. Every bit of data is connected and shared, and different programs are compatible for frictionless end-to-end workflows and seamless collaboration from the far reaches of the globe.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the future, customers like BAS will use Autodesk Forma, the AEC industry cloud, to connect the entire process from concept through construction. Over time, Forma will also enable continued transformation of <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/bim-building-information-modeling\">building information modeling (BIM<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"people working on a computing editing a film\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzJhNGZhNjg5ZTU1LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWZkY2E4OTE4YWQ0ODUzNGEwYTA4M2U0ZWRhODliM2Q2\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Today&rsquo;s media and entertainment workflows, which involve hundreds of people and hundreds of terabytes of data, require centralized asset-management systems like Autodesk Flow to maintain project continuity.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Better Asset Management in the Cloud<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>In another realm&mdash;the imaginary worlds created by the entertainment industry&mdash;movies contain more data in a single shot than most people can appreciate.

Floating PV systems serve two purposes: generating electricity and storing water. Their environmental impact is small due to a minimal footprint, provided the water sources used lack aquatic life.<\/p>\n\n<p>Floating PV systems are not obstructed by trees and other plants, giving them direct access to sunlight throughout the day. Also, water has a cooling effect, which makes solar panels more efficient. The young floating PV market&rsquo;s standards are still being developed, but adoption is quickly expanding, especially for areas where traditional, mounted panels aren&rsquo;t viable. It also aligns with net-zero emissions pledges across the globe; <a href=\"https:\/\/commonslibrary.parliament.uk\/global-net-zero-commitments\/%22%20%5Cl%20%22:~:text=Japan,%20Korea,%20Canada,%20and,emissions%20by%2078%25%20by%202035.\" target=\"_blank\">countries like Japan<\/a> have passed laws committed to net-zero by 2050.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Protect Open Spaces&mdash;Use Water Instead<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Japan has a limited amount of land with good lighting for PV systems, even in mountainous areas. Where they do exist, large-scale mountain forests must be cleared, which is counterintuitive to the zero-carbon initiative.<\/p>\n\n<p>Japanese industrial designer Satoshi Yanagisawa is no stranger to the ecological risks that solar power generation on mountainous, sloped land can pose. &ldquo;In Japan, making solar power systems on mountainsides and similar locations is becoming problematic because trees are being removed,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Chopping down natural green resources to build something that&rsquo;s supposed to benefit the environment is complete nonsense. We need to stop using land for power energy projects. Water is more reliable.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"rendering of floating solar panel\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzRkOTZiMmVlNGEwLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTU5MTM1NjA3YjE4NTBlMGM2NzljMDBlMTQwNmVhNzlm\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Satoshi Yanagisawa is a veteran of generative design projects stemming from his Triple Bottom Line studio.

His studio has a unique focus on a hybridization of modalities from functional interior design products to sustainable machines and mass-producible infrastructures. As a designer, Yanagisawa is naturally drawn to aesthetically pleasing shapes and lines. But as an engineer, he believes that objects should always have a practical function and should be easy to commercialize. It&rsquo;s an ongoing pursuit to find a balance between those two sensibilities.<\/p>\n\n<p>Originally from Japan, Yanagisawa attended university in the UK, where he studied design engineering and material engineering with a focus on product design and sustainable furniture. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/solutions\/generative-design\">Generative design<\/a>&mdash;which uses algorithms driven by artificial intelligence (AI) to generate a wide range of design options well beyond what a team of humans can do&mdash;appealed to him early on, and has created many opportunities to hone his craft and explore practical solutions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Yanagisawa&rsquo;s portfolio includes everything from LED pendant lights to a 3D-printed road bike with Internet of Things (IoT) functionality, which won him a CES Innovation Award in 2016. He also worked on the 2019 iF Design Award-winning <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/engine-control\">DENSO engine control unit<\/a> (ECU), which uses generative design to reduce the weight of an automobile ECU by at least 12%. His most recent accomplishment is a floating device used to generate solar power on water&mdash;a project that Yanagisawa and a small team of five completed in just six months. He estimates this process would have taken more than two years without strategically applying generative design in Autodesk&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/fusion-360\/overview\">Fusion 360<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"rendering of floating solar panel\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzRkOTY0ZDdhZThmLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWRlZWMxOWM5ZTJjMDYzZDgxM2VhMDBjOTI5OTk0NTMw\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The design team relied on computer simulation to test the floating PV system&rsquo;s performance. Courtesy of Satoshi Yanagisawa.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Generative Design and AI for Large-Scale Sustainability Projects <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>A general contractor in Japan was hired to develop a new kind of float for PV systems but didn&rsquo;t have the mass-production knowledge or background needed to make the deadline, so Yanagisawa was called in for his expertise.<\/p>\n\n<p>The contractor had already spent many hours and a good portion of the budget on employee training and sought a way to avoid starting from zero. A project stakeholder knew Yanagisawa&rsquo;s work and thought his background aligned with the mission.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the time, Yanagisawa was working with a small team and decided early on that traditional design and testing methods would not suffice, considering the client had only 15 months to complete the entire project. Many floating PV systems had already been developed, but the actual floats weren&rsquo;t standardized and needed to be designed from scratch. Yanagisawa applied generative design, which quickly turned out 500 float shape options with minimum and optimum wall thickness, based on the assumed strength needed.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Even with the 500 solutions, we realized we needed to modify a few things to meet certain standards,&rdquo; Yanagisawa says. &ldquo;We had to make modifications to the concept models based on feedback from the engineers on the factory side who would be responsible for production. The process is known as DFM [design for manufacturing] or MVT [mass-production verification test], which is generally mandatory for mass-produced products. We also needed to avoid conflicting patent issues as there were already two major companies in the world that did floating PV systems&mdash;a French company and a Chinese company.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Laws, regulations, and standards related to floating solar systems are not fully developed yet, so Yanagisawa and his team established their own standards for the floats based on well-researched existing standards for land-based power generation equipment, floats, and anchors in other fields, as well as standards for water pollution. While incorporating necessary functional design elements, they narrowed 500 options down to just a few and ultimately settled on a final design.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"close up of rendering for floating solar panel\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzRkOTc4ZDA1MmRhLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWZhODRhNmRiNzIzNWI0Mzk1NmU1Y2ZlYTYzNTk5YTdh\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Generative design informed Satoshi Yanagisawa&rsquo;s floating solar system, but he still crafted it to be aesthetically beautiful.

They chose Kagawa, a Japanese prefecture in the northeast of Shikoku Island that&rsquo;s well known in the agricultural industry. The Kagawa soil is fertile and conducive to crop production, and to make up for minimal rain, the locals have developed their own self-sustaining <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kagawa-culture-compass.net\/en\/spot\/048.html\" target=\"_blank\">water supply<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>To verify the floats&rsquo; functionality, a testing facility in Kagawa was created in collaboration with locals in the agricultural industry. There, they began generating their own electricity to power the facility. Computer-aided engineering specialist Misao Mizuno, an expert in structural analysis and fluid dynamics, was enlisted to help throughout the testing phase. He used simulation to analyze whether the model met specific performance requirements.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Computer simulation speeds up the development process and also helps reduce the waste from validation work, as it reduces the need for physical testing,&rdquo; Yanagisawa says. &ldquo;The original plan was to test the actual product for five to six months, but since Misao could replicate most of the tests in the simulation environment, the time was reduced to two months.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>After the two-month period, Yanagisawa&rsquo;s floats passed and have been cleared for mass production. &ldquo;Our system has been working,&rdquo; Yanagisawa says. &ldquo;Right now, it&rsquo;s only in some Asian fields because there&rsquo;s no globally standardized safety regulation yet, but a few European companies are interested.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>PV power generation is still an emerging market, and some new regulations must pass for companies to justify funding something of market scale, but there&rsquo;s definitely momentum. Generative design opens up all types of opportunities for rapid prototyping and testing floating solar; mainstream acceptance could be on the horizon.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"farm of floating solar panels\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzRkOTgwNjY3N2IzLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTk2MjQ5NTcyMmVhYWQ1YTQ4MmM2Y2M0ZDVlYmZlZmRh\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Floating solar farms like this one in dammed water in Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand, provide renewable energy without using arable or forested land.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Human<\/strong><strong>-<\/strong><strong>AI Collaboration<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>With a growing population using more space on the planet, outside-the-box solutions like Yanagisawa&rsquo;s floats could potentially make a huge impact on sustainability. &ldquo;Originally, I&rsquo;m a designer, and I want to make beautiful, clean things,&rdquo; he says. And he would love to see a better translation of style within AI and generative design.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Currently, generative design focuses on proposing mass- and structure-optimized models based on mechanical properties, price, and so on,&rdquo; Yanagisawa says. &ldquo;It is not making aesthetic decisions, but merely processing to meet the mechanical and functional requirements established under specific conditions using metacognition given in advance. The AI&rsquo;s answers may seem disjointed, but to truly collaborate successfully with AI, we need to correctly understand the design language they use and translate it into our own.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Yanagisawa also hopes to solve creating floating solar for the sea. Of course, with sea-based PV systems, there are extreme elements to contend with, including rising sea levels, harsh conditions, and the impact floats could have on biodiversity. Perhaps generative design will be able to pinpoint environmentally friendly solutions in this arena. The collaboration between humans and AI is exciting territory, and when they can build on each other&rsquo;s strengths, the possibilities are limitless.<\/p>\n"},

Among Clean Aviation&rsquo;s beneficiaries are GE Aerospace&rsquo;s Advanced Technology team in Munich, the Dresden University of Technology, and a consortium supporting technology maturation lead by Hamburg University of Technology and joined by Autodesk UK, which together have formed a joint research effort to reimagine more energy-efficient next-generation aircraft engines.<\/p><p>Known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tuhh.de\/ilas\/en\/research\/research-projects\/current-research-projects\/monaco.html\" target=\"_blank\">MOnACO<\/a> (short for &ldquo;manufacturing of a large-scale additive manufacturing component&rdquo;) the joint research effort focuses on the design, optimization, and validation of a large-scale aircraft engine&rsquo;s turbine component via additive manufacturing. The component in question, the turbine center frame, is as complex as it is vital, consisting of more than 100 individual parts.<\/p><figure><img alt=\"Project MOnACO research team\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzUwMmVkYzQxNGM1LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWZmMTkyNjBiYzg2NDliZWJlYWRiYWVmNjBmYmJiYmY4\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The MOnACO research team (right to left): Dr. Hermann Scheugenpflug (GE Aerospace), Dr. Dirk Herzog (TUHH), Dr. Andreas Peters (GE Aerospace), Nick Markovic (Autodesk), Ashish Sharma (GE Aerospace, Project Leader), Dr. Andrea Milli (GE Aerospace), Dr. Guenter Wilfert (GE Aerospace), Andy Harris (Autodesk), Philipp Manger (Autodesk). Courtesy of GE Aerospace.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>&ldquo;What we ultimately set out to do was merge those parts into one,&rdquo; says Andy Harris, a senior principal research engineer at Autodesk Research in London. Streamlining the turbine center frame makes the component easier to manufacture and, most important, lighter. &ldquo;By reducing the weight of the turbine center frame, you use less fuel and therefore produce fewer carbon emissions. Also, using less fuel makes the aircraft cheaper to operate. So there&rsquo;s an economic benefit as well as an environmental benefit.&rdquo;<\/p><p>But amalgamating more than 100 parts is no easy task. To accomplish it, MOnACO leveraged both <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/what-is-generative-design\">generative design<\/a> and additive manufacturing. First, the team defined its design parameters and performance requirements. Then it used Autodesk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/fusion-360\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">Fusion 360<\/a> to automatically generate a slew of design options utilizing an array of different materials and manufacturing processes.<\/p><p>&ldquo;The software gives you information about the performance of the design&mdash;things like stiffness and strength and safety factors&mdash;as well as the mass and the cost of the part based on the material, the manufacturing, and the design itself,&rdquo; Harris says. &ldquo;So it generates all these designs in the cloud, and then you can get rid of the ones that are too expensive, perhaps, or too heavy. It&rsquo;s a really powerful way of doing very quick design exploration.&rdquo;<\/p><p><iframe border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"103\" scroll=\"none\" src=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/hubsFront\/embed_cta\/477252\" width=\"250\"><\/iframe><\/p><p>The team ultimately went through four different design iterations, and each underwent rigorous testing.<\/p><p>&ldquo;We initially did structural simulation, fluid simulation, and manufacturing simulation, and then we would go and make some of these parts in Hamburg and test them in Dresden,&rdquo; says Harris, who adds that the team then compared the actual performance of physical prototypes to its simulations. &ldquo;Every time we did that, we got a better understanding of the real behavior of the part and used that to inform the next design iteration. Each time we were able to improve stiffness, mass reduction, and pressure drop within the system until we ended up with our fourth and final iteration.&rdquo;<\/p><p>A key benefit of the team&rsquo;s final iteration is aerothermal management courtesy of a latticework design achieved using Autodesk Volumetric Kernel, a new tool within Fusion 360 that facilitates design around extremely complex geometry.<\/p><p>&ldquo;There are a lot of hot gases going through this part of the engine, which gets extremely hot and tends to lose a lot of heat,&rdquo; Harris says. &ldquo;By using a lattice to separate an inner skin that gets hot from an outer skin, heat transfer from the inside to the outside is significantly reduced. Over the lifetime of the engine, we estimate that this will save 16 gigajoules of heat energy, which means more energy is going through the engine, driving the turbine, and coming out the back of the engine.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Put simply, the engine runs more efficiently.<\/p><p>But that kind of efficiency isn&rsquo;t attainable through conventional manufacturing processes. The team therefore turned to additive manufacturing&mdash;specifically, laser powder-bed fusion, wherein metal powder is built up gradually in layers and sintered using a high-power laser.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Additive manufacturing offers the design freedom to build almost everything that might come out of a generative design approach,&rdquo; says Dirk Herzog, a researcher at the Hamburg University of Technology. &ldquo;The technology has clearly demonstrated its potential for enormous mass savings, which cannot be achieved otherwise.&rdquo;<\/p><p>In this case, the mass savings are more than 30%, according to MOnACO, which, upon finalizing its design, manufactured a full-scale prototype in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ge.com\/additive\/press-releases\/turn-larger-lighter-additive-parts\" target=\"_blank\">GE additive facility<\/a> with additional post-processing done in an Autodesk facility to verify the printed design against the intended design. Because of the rigorous safety standards that exist in aviation, it will likely be years before the part can be incorporated at scale into real aircraft. Nevertheless, the project is an important next step to realizing meaningful improvements in the environmental impact of aviation.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Aviation is still contributing significantly to carbon emissions,&rdquo; Herzog says. &ldquo;And while electric flying might solve this in the long term, any possibility to reduce emissions of fossil fuel-powered aircrafts needs to be leveraged in the meantime.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The potential is enormous, according to Ashish Sharma, advanced lead engineer for GE Aerospace&rsquo;s Aviation Technology in Munich, who says the project proves the viability of generative design and additive manufacturing for large-scale parts and components. &ldquo;The whole aerospace industry is very excited and interested,&rdquo; he says, emphasizing that the same technologies and processes can be applied to other engine parts to achieve even greater efficiency from nose to tail.<\/p><p>&ldquo;The substantial reduction of the part counts also contributes to improving competitiveness by reducing assembly costs and time,&rdquo; says Christina-Maria Margariti, project officer for the Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking.<\/p><p>Clean Aviation supports launching disruptive new products by 2035, with the aim of replacing 75% of the operating fleet by 2050. Manufacturing speed then is a critical benefit&mdash;especially in the European Union, which has committed to having a carbon-neutral economy by 2050 as part of its European Green Deal initiative. &ldquo;Faster time to market and increased production rates are thus needed in order to achieve entry into new aircraft service by 2035 and a sufficiently high fleet replacement rate to reach the environmental targets by 2050,&rdquo; she says. &rdquo;Any improvement in terms of design and manufacturing process times will be highly beneficial to achieve these objectives.&rdquo;<\/p>"},

Are rail owners up to the challenge?<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Challenges and opportunities<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>The scale and complexity of transport infrastructure initiatives make bringing them to fruition extremely difficult, yet they also present opportunities for rail owners.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Compared to road infrastructure, rail is more complex because of the safety and traffic management systems,&rdquo; says Cristina Vladut, a spokesperson for the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA).<\/p>\n\n<p>There is also a long list of stakeholders to placate, from owners to regulators, local residents living along any proposed new route, politicians, and passengers. Meeting budget, deadline, and quality targets is difficult in a sector marked by cost overruns and structural deficits in planning and execution.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then there are skilled-labor shortages, low margins, policy clashes, and unpredictability in securing building materials.

Today&rsquo;s travelers and shippers have had their service expectations raised by digital transformation. Passengers want glittering train stations, charging points for their gadgets, reliable Wi-Fi, easy trip planning, and e-tickets on their smartphones. Shippers want simpler processes, more flexibility and convenience, and the ability to track their consignments in real time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Throwing sustainability into the mix makes upgraded rail networks an urgent priority, with the capacity to balance demand between people and products.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/agenda\/2021\/12\/rail-freight-transport-climate-change\/\" target=\"_blank\">2021 report<\/a>, the World Economic Forum noted that in the United States, &ldquo;rail freight commands a market share of more than 30%, but in Europe it&rsquo;s less than 20%.&rdquo; Because passenger traffic dominates European rail journeys, freight has to take what&rsquo;s leftover. This affects delivery times and stops some shippers from using rail at all.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>How are rail owners reacting?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>One of Europe&rsquo;s biggest rail owners is grappling with these challenges by developing a strategic investment program that wraps together commercial and strategic objectives, then takes a sustainable approach to achieve them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Deutsche Bahn&rsquo;s <a href=\"https:\/\/ir.deutschebahn.com\/en\/db-group\/sustainability\/the-green-transformation\/\" target=\"_blank\">Green Transformation<\/a> initiative aims to ensure that all big decisions about the German national rail operator&rsquo;s future network design&mdash;and the construction practices that deliver it&mdash;are made with green goals in mind.<\/p>\n\n<p>The 13.6 billion-euro network improvement project is a bid to encourage travelers to take more climate-friendly rail journeys. The railway aims to modernize and renew around 1,800 km (approximately 1,100 miles) of track, 2,000 switch points, 140 bridges, and 800 stations, significantly expanding network capacity and making the existing infrastructure more efficient.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzUyY2UzYmQ1ZWJiLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWI4YjkyNWQ0M2EzM2QwZTFkMDk4ZDU3OTdjOTBmMmVj\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Deutsche Bahn&rsquo;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.deutschebahn.com\/resource\/blob\/6876010\/f6806ac0343a766f59717888becb5412\/BIM-Strategy-Deutsche-Bahn-en-data.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">BIM implementation<\/a> is a key component of its digitalization strategy to expand and improve its rail network in Germany.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>There will also be a focus on digitalization, notably with a shift to the ETCS (European Train Control System) digital control and safety system. Based on European standards, it helps rail operators overcome the problem of cross-border interoperability by making signaling, switching, and other core traffic and safety controls fully digital across Europe.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;A strong infrastructure is the basis for an attractive offer for all rail passengers,&rdquo; said Ronald Pofalla, Deutsche Bahn&rsquo;s director of infrastructure, in a company announcement. &ldquo;We want to convince more people to use the environmentally friendly railway as a means of transport.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/dxj_PbqjoZg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n<p>In Switzerland, national rail operator SBB has undertaken a network-wide digitalization project called <a href=\"https:\/\/bahninfrastruktur.sbb.ch\/de\/digitale-bahn\/ato.html\" target=\"_blank\">SmartRail 4.0<\/a>. It promises pinpoint tracking of train locations in real time, enabling higher densities (more and longer trains) at peak demand times.<\/p>\n\n<p>Planning and control of rail operations is being automated, allowing faults to be fixed faster. Automating scheduling is also improving the reliability of the overall train timetable, which helps save energy.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>MaaS adoption: Why rail&rsquo;s future is digital<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Rail owners also have to consider the impact of macro trends like Mobility as a Service (MaaS), which some futurists believe will define tomorrow&rsquo;s transport.<\/p>\n\n<p>MaaS envisions a unified system where trains will play their part in a range of fully interconnected modes of mobility, sharing a platform with trams, buses, cabs, carshares, and e-scooters.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can see that vision come to life in Helsinki&rsquo;s <a href=\"https:\/\/whimapp.com\/helsinki\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\">Whim<\/a> system, which lets users plan and pay for all modes of public and private transportation in the Finnish capitol. It links the city&rsquo;s trains and trams with buses, taxis, carshares, and bikeshares. Users download the app, create a profile, then enter a destination along with the preferred mode of reaching it. If no single mode can cover the door-to-door journey, the app suggests the best combination.<\/p>\n\n<p>MaaS-centric strategies often go beyond railroads to encompass station buildings, retail facilities, and other facets of customers&rsquo; day-to-day lives. Take RingoPass, the new MaaS service from East Japan Railway Company (JR East)&mdash;an example of a digital transformation that benefits everyone.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"whim app in use at railway station\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzUxYzFmMDkzYzg5LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWUyNGI1NWEyYjQzZTc3YmNmNTQ4OWQ4ODU5Y2FiYmQ3\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mobility as a Service (MaaS) aims to unify transit systems where trains are interconnected with other modes of transit; some transit systems use apps to centralize information.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Secondary transport such as taxis and shared bicycles are part of getting from departure point to destination,&rdquo; Yukiko Ono, deputy general manager of JR East&rsquo;s MaaS &amp; Suica Headquarters, told <a href=\"https:\/\/globisinsights.com\/future-of-work\/jr-east-dx\/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Insights.<\/a> &ldquo;So we thought we should provide the &lsquo;flow&rsquo; to get customers through their whole journey smoothly.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ono explains that this kind of digital transformation is supported by top management. &ldquo;In July 2018, we announced a new strategy called &lsquo;Move UP 2027,&rsquo;&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It includes a commitment by our president and CEO to completely change the way we think. We want to embed innovation into the workplace.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We have trained our mobility behavior over generations, doing the same for 130 years,&rdquo; writes <a href=\"https:\/\/smart-mobility-management.com\/team\/prof-dr-andreas-herrmann\/\" target=\"_blank\">Professor Andreas Herrmann<\/a>, professor of business administration at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, and director of its Institute for Mobility (IMO-HSG).<\/p>\n\n<p>In an IMO-HSG report titled &ldquo;Why Only Collaboration Can Push Mobility as a Service to the Next Level,&rdquo; Herrmann says that bringing MaaS to life will require &ldquo;long-lasting efforts by all [transport industry] players to convince consumers.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>It also requires greater agility and &ldquo;strategic momentum&rdquo; from key industry stakeholders&mdash;rail operators included. That&rsquo;s partly a call for greater technology investment. The institute notes that outdated legacy software and hardware blocks many rail companies from integrating into MaaS platforms.<\/p>\n\n<p>In short, to take their place in transport&rsquo;s connected future, rail systems need to go digital. It&rsquo;s a necessary step for enabling seamless transitions in multimodal trip solutions. It can also aid the design and planning process for upgrading and expanding rail networks to meet future demand.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>The little technology that could<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>As in the wider AEC industry, rail is moving to greater adoption of digital tools to <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/digital-project-delivery\">improve project management and delivery<\/a>.

From BIM to smartphones to 5G networks, the technologies needed to weave together a green digital infrastructure are already here. The world is ready for better trains and better transport&mdash;it&rsquo;s up to the industry to find a common strategy for making it a reality.<\/p>\n"},

To date, Okra Solar has reached more than 1,500 households with clean energy and aims to reach 2 million people by 2025.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You can install the networks in every single house, even if a house is a kilometer away from the rest of the houses, because it&rsquo;s a modular system,&rdquo; says Okra Solar CEO and Founder Afnan Hannan.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"installing a panel as part of an okra solar mesh grid in haiti\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzU2YzY2NmIwOWUzLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWFiODVhOWRlZTkyNDFmZjcxNTFkMmNiNmMyZTliNjRm\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Installing a panel as part of an Okra Solar mesh grid in Haiti. Courtesy of Okra Solar.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>A mesh grid system is a hybrid between a mini solar grid and single-home solar applications, offering lower barriers to entry than the former and more power output than the latter. The centralized infrastructure of mini-grid solar systems has higher setup costs, higher operation and maintenance fees, and can take months longer to install. And single-family-home systems don&rsquo;t generate as much power as mesh grids; the isolation of off-the-grid dwellings means there is little to no reserve power capacity.<\/p>\n\n<p>Per connection, mesh grids are less expensive and more efficient than micro-grids. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re now able to get off-grid households connected at almost half the cost of a traditional mini-grid while giving them the same reliability and availability of power,&rdquo; Hannan says.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Okra system uses just a few small hardware units to connect rural, off-grid settlements, starting with roof-mounted solar panels. An artificial intelligence&ndash;driven, remote site-mapping tool uses geospatial analysis to find the most efficient arrangement for solar panels across the rooftops of the mesh grid.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/okrasolar.com\/pod\/\" target=\"_blank\">Okra Pod<\/a>, designed with Autodesk&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/fusion-360\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">Fusion 360<\/a>, is the system&rsquo;s lynchpin hardware. It&rsquo;s a control unit that manages and distributes the power supply, sending power to multiple houses as demand waxes and wanes for each, whether the mesh grid covers two houses or 200. With batteries installed in each house, the system provides far more flexibility, using excess capacity to deal with elastic electricity demands.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"The Okra Pod, like this one installed in Cambodia, can connect to an inverter with AC outlets for powering full-size appliance\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzU2YzZlYzAxZmUzLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTc3MzdjOGJiM2ExODQ1YjRiNThkMmE3MjNiNzE3NDFj\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Okra Pod, like this one installed in Cambodia, can connect to an inverter with AC outlets for powering full-size appliances. Courtesy of Okra Solar.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The pod makes decisions about, &lsquo;This house needs more power than it has access to, so let me draw more from the grid,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Oscar Aitchison, product manager for Mesh Grid at Okra Solar. &ldquo;Or, &lsquo;I have too much power I&rsquo;m not using, so let me send it out to other houses to charge their batteries up.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;If one house is having a wedding, for example, and they need to run really high-powered lights and speakers to have a great party, then it will be pulling power from the other households that have excess power available,&rdquo; Hannan says.<\/p>\n\n<p><iframe border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"103\" scroll=\"none\" src=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/hubsFront\/embed_cta\/477252\" width=\"250\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n<p>The Pod connects to 2G, 3G, or 4G networks, which are relatively common in remote areas&mdash;and can also connect to Wi-Fi via VSAT satellite technology. The Pod&rsquo;s operations (power distribution, remote monitoring, and mobile billing) are handled by Okra Solar&rsquo;s smartphone app, <a href=\"https:\/\/okrasolar.com\/harvest\/\" target=\"_blank\">Harvest<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Among the many efficiencies that IoT offers, its ability to streamline communication through automation is key for this network. Connecting an off-grid solar network to the IoT provides critical maintenance and infrastructure benefits particular to the developing world. Because the app can troubleshoot issues with the grid&rsquo;s hardware, the bar for technical expertise is lower, so it&rsquo;s possible for residents to handle maintenance and repair.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"A child in Onono, Nigeria uses a computer powered by an Okra Solar mesh grid\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzU2YzdhMzA3YjkzLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTI2YjBkMjQyMTFjZDYxNTMyNTFlZDA1YWM3MmExMzlj\" style=\"float:right; margin:20px 25px\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A child in Onono, Nigeria, uses a computer powered by an Okra Solar mesh grid. Courtesy of Okra Solar.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>&ldquo;If a solar panel was not generating power, we could look at our time series data and automatically use some rules to analyze that and send an alert to the maintenance person on the ground to say, &lsquo;Go to this house and fix the wiring on the solar panel,&rsquo;&rdquo; Aitchison says. &ldquo;That level of automation is really not possible without IoT.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>And in places where transit infrastructure is sparse and travel times are lengthy, relying on local labor is more than an aspect of economic development. &ldquo;These areas can take days to access,&rdquo; Aitchison says. &ldquo;There are often no roads to these places. It becomes incredibly challenging&mdash;and that&rsquo;s if you have that data in advance&mdash;and you have people on the ground in the community who can do small fixes. Then, you don&rsquo;t need to send people out all the time to figure out what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>The mesh grid&rsquo;s lighter infrastructure is also easier to fix. Without a centralized plot of solar infrastructure from which all power radiates outward, there&rsquo;s no heavy, dangerous cabling. &ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;re only sending a small amount of power&mdash;the excess power from one house goes a small distance from one house to the next,&rdquo; Hannan says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re actually using much thinner cables and much lower voltages. Not only is it easier to install and safer, but you&rsquo;re saving more than 90% of costs because you use more lightweight cables and infrastructure.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>So far, Okra Solar has focused on developing mesh grids in the Philippines, Haiti, Cambodia, and Nigeria. Okra Solar&rsquo;s customers are electricity service providers, not individual energy customers&mdash;though they also lease household appliances through Harvest, which can defuse the chicken-and-egg scenario of residents having little need for electricity if they don&rsquo;t have access to the labor-saving home appliances that use it.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Workers in Omolege, Nigeria, install panels for an Okra Solar mesh grid\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzU2YzgyODBmMWI4LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTk0MTNiMmRjNjIxYTI1NzlkYjY3NDljNTc3MDAyNjAx\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Workers in Omolege, Nigeria, install panels for an Okra Solar mesh grid. Courtesy of Okra Solar.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>A mesh grid also can power a wider array of home appliances. Unlike conventional systems that the industry calls &ldquo;solar home systems,&rdquo; Okra&rsquo;s mesh systems allow for more productive power that can run larger devices: refrigerators, washing machines, pumps, electric cookers, rice mills, air conditioning units, and even telecom towers. These tools offer residents greater opportunities for developing economically and starting businesses to improve their quality of life.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the Philippines, Aitchison has seen fishing communities expand their economies simply because mesh grids let them run their own refrigerators that can make ice. &ldquo;Their livelihood is fishing, so they need ice to keep their fish cool and sell it in the market,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Normally, a lot of these communities pay for huge blocks of ice to be shipped to the community, and they&rsquo;ll get a block chopped off and pay a very high rate. It&rsquo;s like a dollar a kilo, which might not sound like a lot to us, but it&rsquo;s very impactful for them.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>But with grid-powered refrigerators, they no longer need to purchase ice and have also been able to start up new freezer-related businesses. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re starting to sell ice cream treats for kids and frozen goods&mdash;new foods that people didn&#39;t even have access to in the community before,&rdquo; Aitchison says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re starting new businesses&mdash;just from having electricity.&rdquo;<\/p>\n"},

Outside, the rays of late summer sun glow on the dry grass; inside, the walls shine with bright incandescence.<\/p>\n\n<p>Francesco Cundari, head of interior design at Automobili Pininfarina, leans against a bar table while making a pencil sketch in a book that contains both cars and animals. &ldquo;In nature, there&rsquo;s a reason for every design,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Form follows function.&rdquo; He turns and points to the Battista, carefully tracing its lines in the air. The power and aesthetic of this electric supercar is the pure embodiment of Italian passion. &ldquo;I transferred this symbiosis of function and form from nature to her,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a reason for every line and a meaning behind every curve.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>What he says is true: The undulating lines are as organic as the waves of the Italian Riviera and as intentional as the switchbacks of the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stelvio_Pass\" target=\"_blank\">Stelvio Pass<\/a>. The Battista&rsquo;s character brings to mind another natural force: the Italian reputation for fiery passion. It&rsquo;s a car you almost don&rsquo;t dare to touch, and it&rsquo;s hard to say whether that&rsquo;s due to its 1,900-horsepower engine or its $2 million price tag.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"battista being built in warehouse\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzU2ZjZhMjk4MDJhLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTAzMzhiZThhZjcwODM4MzdiZDRlODRkNDAyZGRlOTFi\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">It takes at least 10 weeks for the Battista to make its way through the various special production areas at Automobili Pininfarina&rsquo;s northern-Italy facility. Courtesy of Automobili Pininfarina.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Automobili Pininfarina Turns Fantasy Into Reality<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Pininfarina is primarily known as a design studio for famous automotive brands, including Ferrari, Fiat, and Maserati. But the founding father of the company, Battista &ldquo;Pinin&rdquo; Farina, first dreamed of designing his own Pininfarina car decades ago. His visionary prediction from 1959 stands proudly on a board in the production hall: &ldquo;The next automobile revolution will occur when cars move beyond the constraints of the internal combustion engine.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>He was right. Many decades later, his descendants turned his fantasy into reality by producing the Battista under the subsidiary start-up Automobili Pininfarina. The name of the car is a tribute in the truest sense of the word.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>A True Supercar<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>The Battista is one of the fastest electric supercars in the world. It can go from 0 to 100 km (62.14 mph) in less than 2 seconds; has a maximum speed of 350 km\/h (217.48 mph); boasts 1,900 horsepower; and with its four electric motors, 2,340 Nm of torque. Once charged, it can go almost 500 km (more than 300 miles). The 800-volt charging system has a charging power of 250 kilowatts, which makes it possible to charge the battery from 20% to 80% in just 25 minutes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Statistics aside, the Battista also features a superlative design. The low-lying, T-shaped battery&rsquo;s position in the central tunnel (rather than under the floor) leaves plenty of room for design, which makes Cundari very happy. It gave him the freedom to let the minimalist design lines run through the entire chassis, uninterrupted by the wiring normally installed in cars.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"battista car on the docks\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzU3MmIyZDJjOGE1LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTRkMzVmYzRhZDZmMDJkYTI5ODg2ZjM4NTVmNDZiY2E0\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Pininfarina design studio has produced the first car of its own under its subsidiary start-up, Automobili Pininfarina. The Italian company is already calling it a revolution. Courtesy of Automobili Pininfarina.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The electric motor gives us an incredible amount of freedom in design,&rdquo; he says. The two-seater offers 128 million options to customize the color, materials, and engravings of the interior. For the exterior, 13.9 trillion possible combinations include special paint finishes, carbon accents, and lighting.<\/p>\n\n<p>With all these options, it takes 10 weeks to assemble a Battista from start to finish, involving 10 engineers performing more than 1,250 hours of total manual work on every car.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Nature: The Greatest Source of Inspiration<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>When describing the car&rsquo;s design, Cundari always uses examples from nature. He describes the car as having a cocoon-like cabin. Architecture inspires him, as well. &ldquo;A car designer&rsquo;s inspiration should never just come from other cars,&rdquo; Cundari says. &ldquo;Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll end up going in circles, like a dog chasing its own tail.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Although he has used Autodesk&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/alias-products\/overview?us_oa=dotcom-us&amp;us_si=7eef3c1b-c648-48a5-95f1-eba101a5973f&amp;us_st=alias&amp;us_pt=Alias&amp;term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription&amp;plc=ALSCPT\">Alias<\/a>&nbsp;to digitize his ideas for 20 years, Cundari always starts with pencil and paper to give creativity free rein. &ldquo;The new generation of designers tend to start working in the digital&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/product-manufacturing-information\">3D model<\/a> straight away,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m something of a critic of this practice, but maybe I&rsquo;m just jealous.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/PFkAfCSZ0kk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>A New Automotive Design Language<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Cars often used to be boxy,&rdquo; he says. This was mainly because software development was in its infancy. But things have changed completely. &ldquo;Technology has made it possible to create beautiful curves and lines reminiscent of swan necks or diving dolphins,&rdquo; Cundari says. He most appreciates how intuitive the technology is to use. This makes it easy for designers at Automobili Pininfarina and for the students Cundari teaches at Turin&rsquo;s design school.<\/p>\n\n<p>Automobili Pininfarina uses the virtual reality (VR) solution Autodesk&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/vred\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">VRED<\/a> to ensure that it&rsquo;s possible to experience and understand the drawings created in Alias.

The carpeting in the Battista&rsquo;s footwell is also made using&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/circular-design\">recycled fishing nets<\/a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a real privilege to combine innovative technologies with Pininfarina&rsquo;s rich design heritage using sustainable materials and processes,&rdquo; says Sara Campagnolo, director of color and materials design at Automobili Pininfarina.<\/p>\n\n<p>Global Battista production will be limited to 150 cars, and no two will be alike. One of the first Battistas, furnished with swanky gray and red leather seats, will soon be delivered to a customer in the United States. It has already been finished and lies waiting at Automobili Pininfarina&rsquo;s facility on the outskirts of Turin. The motor starts, evoking the sonorous song of the whale, a sound deliberately chosen to provide a soothing balance to the supercar&rsquo;s fiery character. &ldquo;Look at how beautiful she is,&rdquo; Cundari says, like Michelangelo before his<em> David<\/em>.<\/p>\n"},

Cities are constructed with elements&mdash;from heat-absorbing materials to fewer trees for shade and greenery&mdash;that make them far hotter than nearby rural areas, resulting in what meteorologists call the &ldquo;urban heat island effect.&rdquo; But what is an urban heat island; why do urban heat islands form; what can architects to do prevent them; and how can technology help?<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>What are urban heat islands?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>When you think of the world&rsquo;s biggest cities, you probably picture towering steel skyscrapers, concrete car parks, and crowds window-shopping on sidewalks. Together, these are the perfect ingredients to create an urban heat island.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is because during the day, dark surfaces such as asphalt act as &ldquo;heat sponges&rdquo; by absorbing far more solar radiation than lighter surfaces while tall buildings block wind and provide multiple opportunities to reflect sunlight. At night, all this stored heat is slowly released into the air, adding to the additional waste heat from the thousands of air conditioners that city dwellers need to stay safe through hot weather.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;All this means is that our cities are not really cooling down as much at night as they should be,&rdquo; says Dr. Ariane Middel, assistant professor at Arizona State University (ASU). For years, she&rsquo;s researched and simulated urban heat as part of her climate research group <a href=\"https:\/\/shadelab.asu.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\">The SHaDe Lab<\/a>. The majority of her work is currently based in Phoenix&mdash;a city that could soon <a href=\"https:\/\/www.salon.com\/2022\/07\/31\/phoenix-could-soon-become-uninhabitable--and-the-poor-will-be-the-first-to-leave\/\" target=\"_blank\">become uninhabitable<\/a> due to climate change exacerbated by the urban heat island effect.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is a problem that people in city governments have become increasingly aware of,&rdquo; says David Hondula, assistant professor at ASU and director of the Office of Heat Response and Mitigation for the city of Phoenix&mdash;the first publicly funded office of its kind in the United States. &ldquo;What hasn&rsquo;t been clear is who&rsquo;s responsible for tackling the challenges in our cities related to heat.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>With his team, Hondula has been specifically tasked to fight extreme heat in the city before it&rsquo;s too late. Recent projects include the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.phoenix.gov\/streets\/coolpavement\" target=\"_blank\">Cool Pavement<\/a>&rdquo; pilot program, conducted in partnership with ASU, which revealed that reflective asphalt coatings reduced&nbsp;average surface temperatures 10.5 to 12 degrees Fahrenheit compared to traditional asphalt at noon and during the afternoon hours.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/mJ27ohcAu4g\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n<p>Fighting extreme heat is something that every other city government would be smart to replicate&mdash;and the sooner, the better: By 2050, the urban population is projected to more than double its current size, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldbank.org\/en\/topic\/urbandevelopment\/overview%22%20%5Cl%20%22:~:text=Today,%20some%2056%25%20of%20the,world%20will%20live%20in%20cities.\" target=\"_blank\">nearly seven out of 10<\/a> people in the world will live in cities. That means that as climate change creates increasingly extreme heat waves, many more communities will be at risk.<\/p>\n\n<p>The good news is, cities are rising to the challenge of finding cross-disciplinary solutions.<\/p>\n\n<p>September 2022 marked the first gathering of chief heat officers from cities around the globe, organized by the Atlantic Council&rsquo;s Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center, which spearheaded the global <a href=\"https:\/\/onebillionresilient.org\/project\/extreme-heat-resilience-alliance\/\" target=\"_blank\">Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance<\/a>. At the event, the all-female group of policy makers shared the challenges of adapting to the harsh realities of climate change; the event marked the release of the nonprofit&rsquo;s report <em><a href=\"https:\/\/onebillionresilient.org\/hot-cities-chilled-economies\/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\" target=\"_blank\">Hot Cities, Chilled Economies: Impacts of Extreme Heat on Global Cities<\/a><\/em>, which examines the impact of global warming in 12 major urban areas. While some cities are further ahead with mapping and analysis, they share a focus on expanding cooling infrastructure, especially micro-parks and tree canopies.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Mitigating heat through design <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just city governments that can make a difference; architects and designers are increasingly being tasked to mitigate urban heat islands. Tasks can range from optimizing a building&rsquo;s orientation to something as simple as adding more water features to city parks or painting rooftops lighter colors so they reflect heat.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Tokyo Station Yaesu Exit\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzU4NzFkMTAwMDdjLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTg2NWYyNWVjOTk4MmZjNDE4ODk4Mjc4MjVmZDg3OTA4\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">When designing the Tokyo Station Yaesu Exit, the Nikken Sekkei team kept a low roof on the central concourse to create a route for the wind from Tokyo Bay to inland areas.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/passive-house-design\">Passive design<\/a> is a key component of heat mitigation. Encouraging natural ventilation within buildings, for instance, can minimize the use of air conditioning and keep the heat out on sunny days. And it&rsquo;s not just about what&rsquo;s happening inside buildings: Encouraging natural ventilation between buildings makes a big impact. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think many people believe our urban environment is the best it could be,&rdquo; says Hajime Aoyagi, design department supervisor at <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nikken_Sekkei\" target=\"_blank\">Nikken Sekkei<\/a>, a Japanese firm that ranks as the second largest architectural practice in the world.<\/p>\n\n<p>He explains that for the Nikken Sekkei team, it&rsquo;s crucial to plan projects for heat mitigation from the outset. Designing buildings made of sustainable construction materials such as wood can help alleviate the heat island effect, as wood has a much lower thermal capacity than concrete. Making sure buildings are positioned to avoid excessive buildup of heat is also highly effective.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Since we are a firm that is often involved in large-scale development and tend to work on projects at multiple locations in Tokyo simultaneously, we can design from a broader perspective,&rdquo; Aoyagi says. &ldquo;We were involved in the development of the Yaesu Exit of Tokyo Station and intentionally kept a low roof on the central concourse to create a route for the wind from Tokyo Bay to inland areas.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Autodesk Forma microclimate analysis shows the approximate perceived temperatures in Paris\u2019 Place Dauphine.\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82NDQ5NTdjZWQyODU1LnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTQ1MTQ5NWRlMDk4N2NmYTg3NGIxYWEyNzIwNjg1Y2M3\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Autodesk Forma microclimate analysis shows the approximate perceived temperatures in Paris&rsquo;s Place Dauphine.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>For Dr. Middel, creating shade is the most important factor architects should consider when designing cities today. &ldquo;When you look at how people experience heat, it&rsquo;s not just about air temperature,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You also need to look at the radiant temperature, which is how we measure the heat load on the human body. That&rsquo;s strongly driven by the availability of shade. If you&rsquo;re in the shade, you feel much more comfortable than if you&rsquo;re in the sun, no matter where that shade is coming from. That means architects should use buildings, trees, or even photovoltaic canopies to create shade wherever possible.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Not doing so is a risky strategy. As more building certifications like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usgbc.org\/leed\" target=\"_blank\">LEED<\/a> and directives like London&rsquo;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cityoflondon.gov.uk\/assets\/Services-Environment\/thermal-comfort-guidelines-for-developments-in-the-city-of-london.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">thermal comfort guidelines<\/a> begin to reward heat-reduction measures, not taking a city&rsquo;s heat into consideration can result in costly retrofitting years down the line.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the short term, it could even lead to urban designs being ignored altogether. &ldquo;We had a project with a very popular park that was redesigned to have this path leading into it,&rdquo; Dr. Middel says. &ldquo;That meant neighborhood residents wouldn&rsquo;t have to take their car to the park. Sounds great, right? Turns out, nobody would use that path. It wasn&rsquo;t performing in the way the city&rsquo;s architects had expected, and when we measured the heat conditions with our metrological instruments, we knew why. There was no shade whatsoever, and it was miserable to walk on. Fixing this would be a time-consuming and expensive process.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>The role of technology<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Microclimate-analysis technology can help take the guesswork out of designing a project to mitigate the heat-island effect. &ldquo;Technology can help you run scenarios, such as where to plant trees so they&rsquo;ll have the maximum effect on heat,&rdquo; Dr. Middel says. &ldquo;You no longer need to plant them on-site, then see what happens. You can simulate it all on a computer first.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Spacemaker\u2019s microclimate analysis shows approximate perceived temperatures\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzU4NzBjNzc4ODFjLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTc0MTg5YjJlNDBmMjFmZDkzYTZkZjgyODY5ZGI1MzY5\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Forma&rsquo;s microclimate analysis of the Phoenix Art Museum shows approximate perceived temperatures.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>Using tools such as Autodesk&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/forma\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">Forma<\/a>, for example, architects and urban designers can create simulations and easily test mitigation strategies during the planning and design phases. Thermal comfort maps can be created for a specific date and time so anyone can see how a site will handle extreme temperatures. Heat maps can be generated to show exactly when outdoor spaces like public parks and squares will be most and least usable during the day. Together, these types of technologies can ensure cities are developed to be cooler, as quickly and efficiently as possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The most important thing is to act now,&rdquo; Hondula says.&nbsp;&rdquo;Heat&nbsp;is not an isolated problem for anyone. We need to be taking steps today because the city of 30 or 40 years in the future is largely going to be shaped by the decisions we make over the next five to 10 years. With widespread deployment of cooling technologies like trees and reflective surfaces, some modeling suggests we could end up with a city&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;future&nbsp;that is&nbsp;cooler&nbsp;than we have today, even with continued global-scale warming. That is a very encouraging sign.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Note:&nbsp;Currently the Autodesk Forma microclimate analysis is not able to support the effects of various ground types or building materials, instead assuming that the temperature of these surfaces is equal to air temperature.<\/em>&nbsp;<em>These scenarios are created using the 95th-percentile warmest climate results based on weather data for the previous eight years.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><iframe border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"103\" scroll=\"none\" src=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/hubsFront\/embed_cta\/496412\" width=\"250\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n<p><em>This article has been updated.

The project will be complete in 2024. Courtesy of BuildX.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Whole and Healthy Housing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>BuildX broke ground on Zima Homes in June 2022 and will complete the project, which has achieved preliminary <a href=\"https:\/\/edge-cert.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">EDGE certification<\/a>, in early 2024.<\/p>\n\n<p>The company conceived the project during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. &ldquo;During that time, we realized everyone is at home, but many of the homes that people live in are undignified,&rdquo; says architect Etta Madete Mukuba, Zima Homes co-founder and affordable housing lead at BuildX. She adds that sheltering in place might have been more harmful than healthy for people who lived in homes without good ventilation or natural lighting. Designed to serve young, low-income Kenyans&mdash;and whose namesake is the Swahili word <em>zima<\/em>, which means &ldquo;whole and healthy&rdquo;&mdash;Zima Homes will take a holistic approach to sustainability. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just incorporating nature into the building,&rdquo; Mukuba says.<\/p>\n\n<p>For instance, the project ensures thermal comfort through <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/passive-house-design\">passive design<\/a>. &ldquo;We want people inside to experience the space without having to use air conditioning or turn on the lights,&rdquo; continues Mukuba, who says cross-ventilation and large windows with sun-blocking shades are key features. &ldquo;In Nairobi, there is a popular trend where many new buildings are just covering themselves in glass. But in tropical climates, having a building made of glass is basically designing a greenhouse for people. You&rsquo;re going to use a lot of air-conditioning, which uses a lot of power and is not fit for the environment.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Other sustainable features include rainwater-harvesting facilities and high-efficiency water fixtures, solar panels to provide clean and renewable energy to common areas (individual units will be solar-ready for owners who want to install solar power later at their own expense), a landscaped garden, and a green rooftop terrace. Plus, units will have balconies and generous corridors that will double as shared communal spaces.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"rendering of the courtyard of Zima Homes\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzYxYjhlOTVlNjZkLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWMxMjRhNmQwZjM4ZGYxOTU2YmZjMTE2MzRjMjNhZDI0\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Zima Homes&rsquo; sustainable features include solar panels, rainwater-collection facilities, a green rooftop terrace, and large windows with sun-blocking shades for thermal comfort. Courtesy of BuildX.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>And then there are materials, many of which will be <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/future-of-construction\">prefabricated<\/a> and most of which will be locally sourced. That includes prefab wall panels and beam-and-block floors. &ldquo;Prefabricated materials are more sustainable than ordinary materials because it takes less time for construction and because their quality is checked at the factory,&rdquo; Mukuba says. &ldquo;Also, the system can be scaled. That means you only have to do things once, and then you can replicate them across many projects, which ends up reducing your overall consumption.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Technology is a key enabler, according to BuildX architect Wekesa George. &ldquo;Sustainability requires tracking data so you know if you&rsquo;re actually making the impact that you want to make,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Technology makes it very easy to do that.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Specifically, BuildX designed Zima Homes using Autodesk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/revit\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">Revit<\/a>, which can create digital models of the project to simulate and compare the environmental performance of various design choices. When deciding to use beam-and-block floors, for example, the architects could determine the impact it would have on the project&rsquo;s carbon footprint and on the building&rsquo;s operational efficiency relative to traditional concrete slab. Likewise, they could make calculations that helped them minimize the use of certain materials without compromising the building&rsquo;s structural integrity.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It enables us to explore different innovative systems quite quickly and played an important part in the efficiency of our design iterations,&rdquo; says Mukuba, who adds that technology&mdash;for example, artificial intelligence and <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/what-is-generative-design\">generative design<\/a>&mdash;might eventually help BuildX automate its designs as it scales its efforts. &ldquo;We want to build 10,000 affordable homes by 2030. Automation will be instrumental in ensuring we can hit that target.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Building Inclusivity<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>What&rsquo;s good for the environment is good for people, according to BuildX, which says inclusivity and equity go hand-in-glove with sustainability.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sustainability provides affordability,&rdquo; says Wekesa, who adds that traditional notions of affordable housing focus on reducing size and quality whereas sustainable approaches focus on increasing efficiency. &ldquo;If a space is smaller, it costs less. But that&rsquo;s not the only thing you can do. There&rsquo;s much more that you can do to achieve positive outcomes.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"woman working in construction of Zima Homes\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzYxYjk3NTM2YTViLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTdlYjc0Y2I0ZjMyMjI5N2Q3YjY2ZGQzNDdlMzcwMjNk\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Half of the jobs created by the Zima Homes project are filled by graduates of BuildX&rsquo;s sister organization, Buildher, which promotes gender equality in construction. Courtesy of BuildX.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>BuildX believes in equity and inclusivity for the residents who will live in Zima Homes&mdash;and for the workers who are building them. The 18-month project has created 650 jobs, including 100 jobs for low-income people. Filling some of those jobs are graduates of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buildher.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Buildher<\/a>, a nonprofit sister organization to BuildX with a mission to equip young, disadvantaged Kenyan women with accredited construction skills to improve their financial prospects and promote gender equality within the construction sector.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Traditionally in the Kenyan context, construction is quite a discriminatory environment against women,&rdquo; Mukuba says, adding that BuildX makes its construction sites gender-inclusive with accommodations like dedicated restrooms for women and anti-harassment policies. &ldquo;When it comes to homeownership, it&rsquo;s the same thing. In Kenya, only 1% of women are on land titles or homeownership titles, which is crazy because we are 50% of the population. To address that, we&rsquo;re marketing our units by reaching out to women&rsquo;s groups and people who otherwise would not necessarily be targeted for homeownership. Also, we&rsquo;re creating an enabling environment by making sure there&rsquo;s a female representative or a female salesperson to talk people through documents if [prospective buyers] don&rsquo;t feel comfortable.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, what is healthful also will be helpful&mdash;not only for the Kenyans who live in Zima Homes but also for people all over the globe, according to BuildX, which hopes that the project will prove to developers and builders what is possible when they rethink their notions of affordability, equity, and sustainability.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The biggest hindrance to projects like this isn&rsquo;t design or sustainability,&rdquo; Wekesa says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the process of convincing people that it is actually possible to deliver a building that has all these qualities at this price point. The message receives a lot of resistance because it&rsquo;s new and because it&rsquo;s been tried before and failed. But you have to be persistent.&rdquo;<\/p>\n"},

The museum is set to open in 2023, more than 20 years after the late Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak laid a cornerstone of its foundation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The 3,200-year-old statue of the pharaoh, regarded as among the most powerful in ancient Egypt, has journeyed from the quarries of Aswan to the Temple of Ptah in the 13th century B.C., through a centuries-long disappearance, to an archeological rediscovery in 1820 by Italian Egyptologist Giovanni Battista Caviglia. In 2006, the statue was moved from Bab Al-Hadid square in Cairo to the Giza museum complex, where it was restored and housed until 2018 before making its way to the museum&rsquo;s permanent collection.<\/p>\n<script src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.com\/embed\/medias\/4puzbiw71z.jsonp\" async=\"\"><\/script><script src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.com\/assets\/external\/E-v1.js\" async=\"\"><\/script>\n\n<div class=\"wistia_responsive_padding\" style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\">\n<div class=\"wistia_responsive_wrapper\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;\">\n<div class=\"wistia_embed wistia_async_4puzbiw71z videoFoam=true\" style=\"height:100%;position:relative;width:100%\">\n<div class=\"wistia_swatch\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;\"><img alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" onload=\"this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;\" src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.com\/embed\/medias\/4puzbiw71z\/swatch\" style=\"filter:blur(5px); height:100%; object-fit:contain; width:100%\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<p>Transporting and installing priceless antiquities has long been a challenge, but emerging digital technology has made the process much more efficient and somewhat less risky. Before it was brought into the museum, Ramses II was laser scanned to generate a 3D model&mdash;as were many of the museum&rsquo;s estimated 100,000 artifacts tracing Egyptian civilization from prehistory to the Greco-Roman period, including the full collection of artifacts from King Tutankhamun&rsquo;s tomb.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cairo-based firm Orascom led construction of the $1 billion, 5.4 million-square-foot museum campus, now the largest archeological museum in the world. Orascom worked in collaboration with the Egyptian Ministry for Tourism and Antiquities and Brussels-based construction group Besix. Orascom used the laser scans to generate a set of tiny digital pinpricks (known as a point cloud) of Ramses II in Autodesk&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/recap\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">ReCap Pro<\/a>. This point cloud was imported to Autodesk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/revit\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">Revit<\/a> to digitally reconstruct a mesh overlay of the statue that could be placed within the more expansive <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/bim-building-information-modeling\">building information model (BIM)<\/a> describing the entire museum.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"a view of the Ramses II statue at the Grand Egyptian Museum\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82Mzc3ZTQ5MWM0ZDIyLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTBkMmU2YTllMzc4M2FkNWJhMWM4YTQzMTJlYzg3M2E5\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Another view of the Ramses II statue at the Grand Egyptian Museum.

There, it will live in checkered light under a dramatic formwork of latticed steel beams and a louvered, white concrete roof.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s thousands of years old, so it&rsquo;s a very delicate piece,&rdquo; says Khaled El-Said, vice president of Orascom, who heads the company&rsquo;s human resources and IT divisions. &ldquo;Having the model in place helps a lot with maneuverability and installation. Also, when it&rsquo;s there amid other work, you want to make sure it&rsquo;s not blocking other aspects of the exhibition experience.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Ramses II is just one element of the Grand Egyptian Museum embracing technology. Using 21st-century building modeling software was key to integrate the museum&mdash;in siting, orientation, spatial geometry, material use, environmental sensitivity, and even scale and bombast&mdash;into the Giza plateau, where it sits 12 miles from Cairo and just over a mile from the ancient pyramids of pharaohs Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a bid to welcome 5 million visitors each year and revive regional tourism, which has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/history\/article\/giza-pyramids\" target=\"_blank\">declined<\/a> in recent years, the building will host exhibition galleries, children&rsquo;s areas, a conference center with a 3D cinema, retail outlets, a library, and 10 restaurants. The largest part of the program comprises open-air spaces that include piazzas, exhibitions, and many parks and gardens. A special exhibition space will contain a 4,600-year-old wooden ship, or solar boat, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/history\/article\/giza-pyramids\" target=\"_blank\">experts suggest<\/a> &ldquo;may have been part of the pharaoh [Khufu&rsquo;s] fleet in life&rdquo; or &ldquo;designed to carry the resurrected king through the skies following his death,&rdquo; according to <em>Smithsonian <\/em>magazine.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Tourism has the largest potential for growth, the largest impact on the economy,&rdquo; says Osama Bishai, CEO of Orascom Construction, describing the project in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=emCWBpLKxJM\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube video<\/a> created by Oxford Business Group. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time for Egypt to have a great house for their civilization.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"aerial view of the Grand Egyptian Museum\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzZjNTg5NTM2OWMxLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTQ4M2I0NDg5OWU5MWJkNDViMjNmNmYxYWI5OTdlYjQz\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The museum is oriented to align sight lines from its exterior walls to the nearby pyramids. Courtesy of Besix-Orascom&nbsp;joint venture.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Visualization, Spatial Analysis, and Fabrication<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Architecture usually considers the context of its surroundings, but the stakes are higher with monuments of such historic and cultural significance. Modeled using Autodesk Revit and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/bim-360\/\">BIM 360<\/a>, the museum&rsquo;s orientation visually connects past and present, framing sight lines from the museum&rsquo;s exterior walls to the vertices of the three Giza pyramids&mdash;almost as though the buildings were born synchronously from a single-perspective drawing with a shared vanishing point.<\/p>\n\n<p>Shehab Shenouda, executive director of project methods and controls at Orascom, describes one gallery that offers a view of the three pyramids in &ldquo;one homogenous picture,&rdquo; as though they are a distant extension of the museum itself. It creates &ldquo;a complete view of the three pyramids actually as if the three pyramids are part of the museum,&rdquo; adds El-Said&mdash;and is also a technical feat that would have been nearly impossible using traditional surveying methods.<\/p>\n\n<p>The immense scale and beveled triangular form of the museum, echoing the Giza pyramids, was designed by Henegan Peng Architects, selected from 1,557 entries in an international design competition hosted by the Egyptian Ministry of Culture and UNESCO. &ldquo;What drove the unique architectural design is choosing a ray point&mdash;this is the museum,&rdquo; Shenouda says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s projecting out to the three pyramids from a certain point, a ray of light shining through the museum all the way to the pyramid.&rdquo; A massive white concrete roof, with gill-like slabs spanning up to 130 feet in length, required seamless connections among the structural steel beams, joints, and formworks to accommodate specially mixed concrete from French manufacturer LaFarge.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;When you have a triangular shape like this in three dimensions, you don&rsquo;t have a repetitive form for the slabs; each has a different geometry,&rdquo; Shenouda says. &ldquo;We had to fabricate the specific formwork and rebar, bay by bay. Nothing is replicated.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"outside of grand egyptian museum\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzZjNTkxYTc2M2Y4LkpQRyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWE5NDg3OWVkMmY4MDVmOWMyODc0YTcxNWJiZDJiZWEz\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The museum&rsquo;s vented, cascading roof, built from 10 million cubic feet of concrete, helps keep the galleries inside at a constant 73 degrees Fahrenheit. Courtesy of Besix-Orascom&nbsp;joint venture.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>Using Autodesk Dynamo, the team composed custom scripts to automate the modeling of subtle iterations of these elements. More than 10 million cubic feet of concrete poured hot into asymmetrical formworks created the cascading roofline, accentuated by 100-foot-high &ldquo;stilettos,&rdquo; which flank the grand staircase. The ventilated concrete roof and facades also minimize heat conductivity, ensuring the galleries can be naturally maintained at 73 degrees Fahrenheit, even when the temperature on the external surfaces reaches a sweltering 150 degrees in the height of the summer heat. &ldquo;Imagine the amount of energy that saves having to air-condition this,&rdquo; El-Said says. &ldquo;Of course, there is air conditioning, but you reduce a lot the electrical load and everything that goes along with it ...That&#39;s a key element in the environmental-protection aspect with the design of this project.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>The complex features an air-quality monitoring station, connected to the National Industrial Emissions Control Network of the Environmental Affairs Agency, which collects data that contributes to the process of controlling pollution in accordance with local environmental-protection laws. Many construction materials are manufactured and purchased locally, and mechanical equipment and electrical devices were selected based on their energy savings to meet sustainability requirements.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>BIM and 3D Project Coordination<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>The project&rsquo;s <em>coup de gr&acirc;ce<\/em>, perhaps, was the coordination of information across a team that included 150 subcontractors and 5,000 on-site workers across a nearly half-mile-long campus. BIM 360, introduced as the <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/data-interoperability\">common data environment<\/a> midway through construction, brought efficiency to a time-consuming scoping process that, El-Said says, once required subcontractors&rsquo; models to be manually reviewed and approved by Besix-Orascom&rsquo;s joint-venture in-house BIM team before the subcontractors could issue fabrication drawings. An accessible interface expedited a project two decades in the making and already significantly delayed by two political revolutions and the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"outside view of construction at the grand egyptian museum\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzZjNTllMzNmZDg4LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTBjN2M1MTM3MDEzNTk1MzE3YjA1YWEwZmNjZDFkNDNm\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Besix-Orascom&nbsp;joint venture&rsquo;s team used BIM to coordinate more than 150 subcontractors and 5,000 workers on the jobsite. Courtesy of Besix-Orascom&nbsp;joint venture.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>In essence, the 3D environment served as a virtual replica, or <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/what-is-a-digital-twin\">digital twin<\/a>, of the physical landscape. By displaying real-time updates of &ldquo;as-built&rdquo; conditions in a shared, cloud-based interface, BIM 360 helped disparate teams access files and coordinate workflows. All told, the shared model recorded more than 1,000 change requests; 4,000 bill-of-quantities requests; 12,000 extracted requests for information (RFIs); 45,000 extracted shop drawings; and 33,000 extracted as-built drawings. BIM was also used to flag potential clashes between HVAC, electrical, and plumbing systems, reducing MEP installation rework orders to fewer than 5% of the total, with a minimal clash rate.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Modeling helps with cyclic construction,&rdquo; Shenouda says. &ldquo;You can do procurement manually, but on a project of this scale, with changes happening on a daily basis, there are bound to be errors. Having one source of truth behind the data and incorporating subcontractors&rsquo; changes and input&mdash;hopefully, in a timely way&mdash;helps you execute effectively.&rdquo;<\/p>\n"},

According to a recent <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/featured-insights\/diversity-and-inclusion\/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters?cid=other-eml-alt-mip-mck&amp;hlkid=4544abd2e8754189a\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>McKinsey report<\/strong><\/a><strong>, companies that focus most on racial and ethnic diversity outperform those that don&rsquo;t by 36%. And companies with gender diversity on the executive team were 25% more likely to experience above-average profitability. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Diversity encompasses far more than ethnicity or gender, though: It&rsquo;s about having a greater variety of opinions and perspectives on a team, which reduces all sorts of weaknesses. This has been reported to lead to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.peoplemanagement.co.uk\/experts\/research\/diversity-drives-better-decisions\" target=\"_blank\">60% improvement<\/a> in decision-making along with increased <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/rocio_lorenzo_how_diversity_makes_teams_more_innovative?language=en\" target=\"_blank\">creativity and innovation<\/a>, and even <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2017\/03\/teams-solve-problems-faster-when-theyre-more-cognitively-diverse\" target=\"_blank\">faster<\/a> problem-solving.<\/p>\n\n<p>Yet in the architecture, engineering, and construction (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/autodesk-university\/class\/Discussion-Diversity-Problem-AEC-Industry-2020\">AEC<\/a>)&nbsp;and&nbsp;design and manufacturing&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.heidrick.com\/Knowledge-Center\/Publication\/Enhancing_diversity_The_manufacturing_mind_set_advantage\" target=\"_blank\">D&amp;M<\/a>) industries, progress on inclusivity has been slow. In construction, for example, a survey from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/cps\/cpsaat18.htm%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\" target=\"_blank\">found<\/a>&nbsp;that Black Americans comprise <a href=\"https:\/\/constructionblog.autodesk.com\/diversity-inclusion-construction\/\">just 6%<\/a> of the country&rsquo;s construction workforce and that only 9.9% of construction professionals are&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/constructionblog.autodesk.com\/25-women-in-construction\/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\">women<\/a>. (The figure is higher, but still hugely imbalanced, at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.womeninconstructionsummit.com\/blog\/wice-note-from-the-producer\" target=\"_blank\">14%<\/a>&nbsp; in Europe).<\/p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/autodesk-university\/class\/Why-Diversity-and-Inclusion-AEC-Industry-Necessary-How-Achieve-It-2019\">engineering<\/a>, studies by the <a href=\"https:\/\/swe.org\/about-swe\/\" target=\"_blank\">Society of Women Engineers<\/a> have shown that only 13% of engineers are women (that figure is as low as 2% for women of color) and that female engineers still earn <a href=\"https:\/\/alltogether.swe.org\/2018\/09\/swe-research-update-women-in-engineering-by-the-numbers\/\" target=\"_blank\">10% less<\/a> than their male counterparts. Just 19% of engineers are underrepresented minorities, and only 20% of engineers are disabled.<\/p>\n\n<p>AEC and D&amp;M business leaders who go beyond the rhetoric and take effective action to bridge these gaps will send a powerful message&mdash;as well as benefit from the results. As disruptions caused by new technologies and remote working continue to evolve the<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>workplace, here are five strategies industry leaders can take to effect change and promote diversity among age groups, cultures, ethnicities, sexual orientations, class backgrounds, and beyond.<\/p>\n\n<h2>1. Familiarize yourself with employee circumstances&mdash;and normalize different ways of working<\/h2>\n\n<p>Virtual work can come with <a href=\"https:\/\/launchpadrecruits.com\/insight-articles\/why-remote-employees-may-be-the-key-to-workplace-diversity\" target=\"_blank\">huge benefits<\/a> for organizations looking to onboard a more diverse, distributed workforce. Simply switching from local to global hiring practices, however, is not enough. Business leaders also need to review the circumstances of all talent to ensure workplace culture is not only diverse but also inclusive to all. Part of this can be as simple as implementing a no-camera day to avoid Zoom fatigue.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We need to use common sense to think about where everyone is,&rdquo; says Randy Howder, principal and managing director at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gensler.com\/\">Gensler<\/a>. &ldquo;We have a couple of employees who won&rsquo;t turn on their cameras because they&rsquo;re embarrassed about their backgrounds. One younger employee who has a lot of roommates was famously taking his Zoom calls from the bathroom because it was the only place in the house where he could have privacy.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not just young employees,&rdquo; says Susan Etlinger, a senior fellow at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cigionline.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Centre<\/a> for International Governance Innovation and member of the United States Department of State <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldlearning.org\/program\/u-s-speaker-program\/\" target=\"_blank\">Speaker Program<\/a>. &ldquo;There are people who might have disabilities where they find it too distracting to be on camera. Even with a distributed workforce, you can start to see inequality issues surface that would be detrimental to retaining diverse teams.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>To build a more inclusive, supportive workplace, Etlinger advises organizations to normalize different ways of working and communicating: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a real opportunity for leaders to engage with talent one-on-one and to become personally accountable for promoting diversity and inclusion within their team every day. By starting that dialogue, firms can look for ways to promote more equitable working arrangements.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Leaders should hold themselves accountable for checking in with staff to ensure the organization isn&rsquo;t just recruiting diverse teams, but creating an inclusive environment.<\/em><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n\n<h2>2. Upgrade performance-management practices<\/h2>\n\n<p>Regular check-ins with staff should also enable AEC and D&amp;M leaders to adapt performance-management practices to foster more diversity and inclusion. This should be a priority to get right: Research has shown that women&mdash;who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/318260107_Women's_Reasons_for_Leaving_the_Engineering_Field\" target=\"_blank\">frequently decide<\/a> to leave fields like engineering&mdash;are also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.progressivewomensleadership.com\/how-gender-bias-affects-your-performance-reviews\/\" target=\"_blank\">1.4 times<\/a> more likely to receive critical subjective feedback.<\/p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s crucial to consistently train management to recognize everyone&rsquo;s accomplishments without bias, regardless of ranking or status. And that&rsquo;s not just about holding an annual refresher course: Training and check-ins with staff should be constant and consistent.<\/p>\n\n<p>Reviews should also become a good time to solicit feedback from team members about their ideas for fostering a more inclusive environment. Leaders can then use this information to better <a href=\"https:\/\/damassets.autodesk.net\/content\/dam\/autodesk\/draftr\/12384\/Altimeter_2020_Strategies%20for%20Resilience%20in%20Disruptive%20Times_v5.0.pdf\">factor context<\/a> into performance management.<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, a data-driven approach to exit interviews and grievances will ensure leadership can better analyze problem areas and assess why talent leaves the firm.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Context-driven feedback, more transparent performance criteria, and management training should all be implemented to reduce bias in performance reviews.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<h2>3. Encourage new business models<\/h2>\n\n<p>A flat hierarchy that promotes multidisciplinary teams might sometimes be seen as a radical shift, but the disruptions of the past year have proven that this could seriously help improve employee confidence, as well as encourage the uniqueness each individual brings to the table.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Being all remote has been a great leveler; more people are feeling connected and able to share,&rdquo; says former Autodesk CMO Lisa Campbell. &ldquo;I feel like I know people on my team better than ever before. I&rsquo;ve met their children, their spouses, their pets, and we are very welcoming of that. Before COVID, it used to be considered a terrible interruption, and people would be frustrated by it. And now we all laugh and say, &lsquo;Hey, I know their kids&rsquo; names. I&rsquo;ve seen their Halloween costumes.&rsquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen a flattened hierarchy because everybody&rsquo;s on the same dimension on the screen,&rdquo; Howder says. &ldquo;On our teams, I&rsquo;ve seen that some of that missing body language is good because those signals of power and control are muted a little bit. I have noticed younger people having more of a voice or feeling more comfortable with the medium.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;A lot of these remote-collaboration tools will mute anyone who isn&#39;t speaking, so you now have a situation in which people&#39;s voices can be heard, who were not heard before,&rdquo; Etlinger says.<\/p>\n\n<p>For companies planning to return to the office or for firms with staff currently working on site, it&rsquo;s important that leaders translate these learnings to a physical space. Can historic metrics such as square footage per employee <a href=\"https:\/\/damassets.autodesk.net\/content\/dam\/autodesk\/draftr\/12384\/Altimeter_2020_Strategies-for-Growth-in-the-Reimagined-Workplace.pdf\">be rethought<\/a> to enhance social cohesion and value creation? Could offices become social hubs and meeting centers, rather than fixed locations for desk-based work? Or could they be used to drive mentorship schemes designed to create diversity in future leaders while also rewarding mentors accordingly&mdash;rather than simply burdening mentors with the need to educate others as a side effect of who they are?<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Flatter hierarchies bring many benefits to the table, including giving those who don&rsquo;t normally have the space the opportunity to speak up. <\/em><\/p>\n\n<h2>4. Be more open to flexible working, but watch weak ties<\/h2>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our industry has been notoriously difficult for women and historically has not had a very strong contingent of minorities,&rdquo; says Hao Ko, principal and managing director at Gensler. &ldquo;For someone to step away for a few years to have a family or to deprioritize a client deadline because one has other responsibilities has not been easy for people.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>One potential solution has been to adopt more agile working practices. In fact, research has shown that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cipd.co.uk\/news-views\/news-articles\/flexible-working\" target=\"_blank\">flexible<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesbusinesscouncil\/2020\/07\/28\/how-remote-work-can-enhance-workplace-diversity\/?sh=5ced7cc4e6a7\" target=\"_blank\">remote<\/a> work can enhance workplace diversity. That said, offering remote work alone isn&rsquo;t enough: A poll suggested that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.peoplemanagement.co.uk\/news\/articles\/two-thirds-of-employees-feel-less-connected-working-from-home\" target=\"_blank\">two-thirds<\/a> of employees who shifted to working remotely in 2020 felt less connected when working from home. That isolation can lead to a less inclusive culture, especially for those who are newer to the job.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;One of my colleagues put it this way: We left the office on March 13 with our relationship bank accounts totally full, and we&rsquo;re burning through that relationship cash,&rdquo; Howder says. &ldquo;But the younger people were living relationship paycheck-to-paycheck, and they don&rsquo;t have that well of resources. They&rsquo;re missing out on building their personal networks. They&rsquo;re missing out on mentorship.

In business since the early 1970s, the company has delivered thousands of projects in its key California and Canadian (British Columbia and Alberta) markets. In fact, Starline Windows is&nbsp;responsible for making and installing the windows and doors in 25% of the high-rise buildings constructed during the past 50 years of the Vancouver, Canada, downtown core&mdash;the area most known for the city&rsquo;s iconic skyline.<\/p><p>Starline&rsquo;s array of window products includes punched, window-wall, curtain-wall, and balcony door. Unlike many manufacturing businesses that opted to outsource in the 1980s, Starline has stuck with a vertically integrated corporate structure in which most of its supply chain is company-owned, including state-of-the-art, fully automated manufacturing facilities.<\/p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a really special company,&rdquo; says Catherine Walmsley, virtual construction manager at Starline. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re quite unique, and I think that comes down to not just what we do, but how we do it.

However, even with the level of control afforded by its integrated structure, the company still faces business challenges common to the <a href=\"https:\/\/essential.construction\/academy\/tutorials\/basics-of-building-envelope-construction\/\" target=\"_blank\">envelope<\/a> trades, including a lack of design collaboration with architects and contractors, poor visibility for field personnel when design revisions happen, and limited data sharing between the office and the field.

Labor and supply shortages complicate the issue. By 2025, the construction industry could face a shortage of <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.autodesk.com\/autodesk-foundation\/2022\/03\/15\/our-investment-in-pallet\/\">2 million workers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>But in the United States, permanent-housing interventions have grown by 450% in the past five years, as cities and states struggle to solve the problem and to move homeless individuals into stable housing and careers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>As part of this fight, an Everett, WA&ndash;based company has a scalable product and workforce model to build the bridge to permanent housing and dignified work. <a href=\"https:\/\/palletshelter.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Pallet<\/a>, an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.org\/\">Autodesk Foundation<\/a> portfolio organization, is a public benefit corporation that creates rapid-response shelters to bring the safety and security of a home to the most vulnerable populations. The shelters, and villages they comprise, are deployed in a matter of hours and days, not months or years. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We need a solution now so that people aren&rsquo;t dying in the elements on the streets,&rdquo; says Pallet Founder and CEO Amy King. &ldquo;So the rapid deployment has to do with life-saving measures.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>King advocates for housing as a human right. &ldquo;Housing in and of itself is hard to build and really expensive,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We know that because we build that.&rdquo; King and her husband also founded Square Peg, a general construction company.

The company employs an in-house engineering and design team, which incorporates the lived expertise feedback of end users. &ldquo;That means all products are designed in-house and are constantly evolving to ensure we are meeting market needs,&rdquo; King says.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Today, Pallet is on the eighth generation of its shelter, and the engineering changes with each successive model come directly from feedback of community members living in the units. Pallet is focused on light, nonindustrial manufacturing, primarily performing fabrication and product part assembly. For this, it uses Autodesk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/inventor\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">Inventor<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/vault\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">Vault<\/a> and is &ldquo;actively working now to determine the best-use case for integration as we pursue efficiency and continue to expand product offerings,&rdquo; King adds.<\/p>\n\n<p>The temporary communities offer shelters with doors that lock; onsite social services; and access to food, showers, and laundry. Plus, the population Pallet serves can bring pets and personal possessions to their new, temporary homes. Partners are also welcomed to stay together. These humane elements may seem commonplace but are often not present in many shelter systems, which can deter individuals from seeking the help they need.<\/p>\n\n<p>Together, the service organizations and government entities work to transition individuals in the villages to permanent housing and establish pathways to employment, which can include employment with Pallet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Dignified Work to Meet Growing Labor Needs&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Pallet CEO and founder Amy King.\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82Mzg2YjdhYzg0ZWI5LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWQ3MDczMTJmYTAxOTQ0YmYwODdmZGQwMzVhNDE1YWU3\" style=\"float:right; margin:20px 25px\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">CEO Amy King founded the Pallet public benefit corporation not only to deploy rapid-response temporary housing but also to address holistic community needs like employment development and other services.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>As much as King thinks the Pallet shelters and villages are impacting the homelessness crisis, she believes in her companies&rsquo; workforce-development model more and says other businesses should embrace it in their search to develop the next generation of employees, too.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We have a product that&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; King says. &ldquo;But our primary mission is to build living-wage jobs and skill sets and help people grow.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>King tells other business owners that the decision to expand their hiring sphere to include people with different, and sometimes difficult, lived experiences is one that has rewards beyond the factory floor or warehouse.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We have to invite people into the idea that homelessness and displacement are not solved with a house,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Four walls and a roof do not solve displacement.

That&rsquo;s the magic that&rsquo;s going to create sustainable solutions.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>To that end, King seeks to hire people who have struggled to attain and maintain regular employment&mdash;namely, people who have experienced homelessness or addiction and those exiting the criminal justice system.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The vast majority of our staff have significant history of justice-system involvement,&rdquo; King says. &ldquo;And I can tell you from experience with them&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve met thousands and thousands of people with these histories that have worked for us or been in one of our programs&mdash;that they&rsquo;re some of the most brilliant, intelligent, creative, productive citizens I&rsquo;ve ever met.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Through years of conversation, King says her employees and Pallet community members have shared how difficult it is to get jobs&mdash;regulations and legislation sometimes prevent people with criminal pasts from employment. Prejudice piles on the stigma, too.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this vicious cycle that people can&rsquo;t get out of,&rdquo; King says. &ldquo;Then, they&rsquo;re trapped in poverty. But for us, offering someone a job is a very simple way of saying, &lsquo;We believe in you.&rsquo; We help train and promote them to a place where they can set dreams for themselves. Then, they&rsquo;re marching down a path, and they know that they have a purpose in the world. Eventually, you&rsquo;re not needed anymore. They now believe in themselves enough to stay on that path to that end point.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>King admits her message meets hesitancy from companies and managers who are reluctant to hire outside the typical employment standards. To answer that, King says policy has a place, but people have a place, too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The only way to break down human bias is to smash the populations together and introduce them to each other, so we try to do that,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We try to take our people into their world to tell their stories so that people can say: &lsquo;I met someone who comes from that background. They&rsquo;re an engineer at Pallet, and they make six figures, and they have a house and a kid. People can change!&rsquo; You have to provide them that example.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;As an employer, the standard used to be that you couldn&rsquo;t hire anyone with a felony background ever,&rdquo; King continues. &ldquo;But there have to be people who come along and ask, &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; Because people with felonies, they&rsquo;re not bad people. The vast majority of people actually respond [to rehabilitation during incarceration] and are willing to do something differently. The difference is we need someone to see them and say, &lsquo;I see potential in you; let me spark that potential in you,&rsquo; whether it be through a job, offering them housing, a community, whatever it might be.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Pallet Shelters Chandler finished village\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82Mzg2YjdmNmE3ODMzLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWI4ODVlNTk1YTU3ZjQ5MDY2NDZlNmYxMjkyNTVlMDdh\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pallet&rsquo;s new village sites cost about 1\/16th of its first village and are built much faster.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Partnering With Cities for Long-Term Change<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Pallet&rsquo;s primary clients are cities, counties, and states experiencing a significant homelessness crisis. These groups have found Pallet&rsquo;s model attractive for its low barrier to entry and holistic offering of support in overcoming some of their most difficult challenges, including site selection, housing supply, social-service connections, community adoption, and political process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is a long partnership,&rdquo; King says. &ldquo;This is a long game. We want to help a city solve its homelessness crisis holistically. We&rsquo;re usually leveraging local partners, but we&rsquo;re acting as the convener to bring all the stakeholders together so that people who are displaced are getting all their needs met across the board.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;One [partnership] in particular where we have made significant progress in our set-up process is the city of Los Angeles,&rdquo; King says. &ldquo;They have a huge crisis with 66,000 people living in unsheltered conditions. We had about a year of conversation, trying to figure out the mechanics of how we were going to do this in this very dense, urban environment where there&rsquo;s not a lot of land availability.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>The first Los Angeles site launched in 2020, but its deployment was initially not considered to be an outright success. &ldquo;Our very first site was expensive, took longer than usual to build, had a lot of challenges with the community,&rdquo; King says. &ldquo;But in the end, it got deployed.&rdquo; That site is still operating today and has helped Pallet and the city of Los Angeles to improve future sites.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;When we moved on to site No. 2, we said, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s work together to figure out how to make this better,&rsquo;&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;This was really our first attempt at partnering with a city on all aspects of deployment.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Since then, Pallet has enjoyed a close working partnership with the city&rsquo;s Bureau of Engineering&mdash;a group of local architects, general contractors, and city staff&mdash;to ensure each site deployment is streamlined, cost effective, and as easy as possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;These new sites are about 1\/16th of the cost of the first one,&rdquo; King says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing it much cheaper, and we&rsquo;re getting the sites built out much faster.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Pallet shelter interior\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82Mzg2YjgxZWIzOTQ5LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTQ2MTAzNjE0NGIxMDA5YmM5YjY4NmZhYTQ2OTdmYzBi\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Pallet shelters are private sleeping cabins with lockable doors and onsite resources.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2>Embracing Empathy and Mission in Business<\/h2>\n\n<p>Ultimately, King hopes the mission of Pallet could one day be fulfilled and that homelessness in the United States could be solved, whether with Pallet&rsquo;s products or other solutions. For that, King will need her employees to be prepared and invested in the business and the mission.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;A lot of business owners, especially in companies that have shareholders, have a focus on profitability&mdash;and I have no issue with that,&rdquo; King says. &ldquo;You have to be sustainable. But we lose sight of what matters: None of that profitability is possible without people.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>King tells her fellow business leaders to always consider what their mission is and how it helps their community&mdash;and consider when that mission is more important than the bottom line.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Recognize that there are moments in business for profitability, and there are moments for mission,&rdquo; King says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re often in conflict with each other. As a social enterprise, I can tell you we weigh if an opportunity is a mission moment or a profit moment. We default right now toward a mission moment because we&rsquo;re trying to get market saturation to solve the problem. Other times, there is a profitability moment. If you can identify those moments as a business owner and capitalize on both, then you can both have an impact in your community and be sustainable with a healthy bottom line.<\/p>"},

If the evidence from Asia-Pacific (APAC) is any guide, they definitely <em>can<\/em> be.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2019\/05\/the-power-of-hidden-teams\" target=\"_blank\">evidence<\/a> proving that well-integrated teams boost efficiency and raise productivity. Now, the rapid embrace of digital is adding another dimension to teamwork: innovation through shared endeavor.<\/p>\n\n<p>In APAC, this is driving the creation of new products, services, and revenues for businesses across the spectrum&mdash;from start-ups to SMEs and global multinationals.<\/p>\n\n<p>The trend is taking shape in APAC&rsquo;s embrace of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/solutions\/architecture-engineering-construction\/smart-cities\">smart cities<\/a>. UBS predicts Asia will account for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ubs.com\/content\/dam\/WealthManagementAmericas\/cio-impact\/Smart-Cities-7-March-2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">40%<\/a> of the global market in smart-city projects by 2025&mdash;tens of billions&rsquo; worth of new investment in infrastructure, construction, consulting, engineering, and digital tools&mdash;all enabled by tighter collaboration among government, business, and technology firms.<\/p>\n\n<p>That shared ambition, coupled with the rapid expansion of Asia&rsquo;s digital economy, has given rise to an extremely competitive innovation ecosystem that sees manufacturing, construction, financial services, and other sectors collaborate on long-term, big-picture objectives.<\/p>\n\n<p>Asif Moghal, head of market development in Design &amp; Manufacturing at Autodesk, says improved collaboration is &ldquo;the No. 1 thing&rdquo; customers want from technology. At a recent workshop with APAC customers, he posed this question: If you had 100 units of any currency to spend on technologies for collaboration, customer experience, flexible manufacturing, mass customization, and smart services, how would you split it?<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Everyone put the majority of their hypothetical budget into collaboration,&rdquo; Moghal says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s hardly surprising considering collaboration helps you work with greater speed, effectiveness, and quality, which yields almost instant benefits such as productivity and efficiency. But collaborating also gives another big benefit: It increases the chances of spotting all types of innovation far earlier. With the right digital capabilities, collaboration can allow a company to validate those innovations and bring them to market faster and at lower risk.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Tech loves a catchy portmanteau, so here&rsquo;s another one: collab-ovation. It may not roll off the tongue, but it&rsquo;s an accurate description of what&rsquo;s driving innovation in Asia-Pacific, a region expected to contribute to roughly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/agenda\/2019\/12\/asia-economic-growth\/\" target=\"_blank\">60%<\/a> of global growth by 2030.<\/p>\n\n<p>The following success stories make the case.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82Mzg4MDM5MDM0ZGU5LmpwZWcmdmVyc2lvbj0wMDAwJnNpZz0xYTViZTM1MTUwM2IzMGU4OTM5ODk0MzVmM2MzZDc2YQ%253D%253D\" style=\"height:331px; width:700px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h2>Daiwa House: Improving Disaster Response<\/h2>\n\n<p>Osaka, Japan&ndash;based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.daiwahouse.com\/English\/\">Daiwa House Group<\/a> is a pioneer in rapid building systems for temporary housing. The technology is a central component of Japan&rsquo;s national disaster response system, housing displaced people in the aftermath of earthquakes and flooding.<\/p>\n\n<p>The group&rsquo;s prefabrication technology was tested to the limits when a magnitude 7 earthquake struck the Japanese city of Kumamoto in April 2016. Thousands of housing units were needed in the immediate vicinity of the quake. And while more than 4,300 were built in the following months, company leaders realized that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events demanded a faster solution.<\/p>\n\n<p>They collaborated with researchers at Kumamoto University to shorten the planning and approvals phase&mdash;one of the most time-consuming elements in any emergency-accommodation project. Creating a construction plan for temporary housing can take a week or more to complete, a process often complicated by limited resources, heavy scrutiny by local officials, and sketchy information.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s similar to the planning of a town,&rdquo; says Tokio Yajima, who works in the Quality Assurance Dept. in the Administration Div. of Daiwa Lease Co. Ltd. &ldquo;The layout plan has to be communicated to stakeholders in local government several times, then redrawn based on the needs of the disaster site. The task was repetitive&mdash;taking it home, modifying it, bringing it back the next day, meeting, then modifying again and again.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p>Using computer-generated visualizations, the combined team developed a way to streamline the planning process with automation. Users could manually enter site boundary information; then, the system would automatically create an accurate layout with all houses, roads, and parking lots.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rather than spending a week or more to generate a disaster-housing plan, the new program can generate an initial site layout in about an hour. Because local government coordination and approval is vital to keep things moving forward, the faster layout process improves communication and speeds up turnaround when changes need to be made. The process can also respond quickly to feedback from stakeholder meetings, allowing changes to be made on the spot.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82Mzg4MDNiNTdmM2NmLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTRlM2Y5M2MxYWRiZWRlY2ZlMmI3MjlkMzkwMmE2OWE4\" style=\"height:333px; width:700px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h2>Tiong Seng Contractors: Healthier Construction Outcomes<\/h2>\n\n<p>Singapore&rsquo;s <a href=\"https:\/\/excellenceawards.autodesk.com\/projects\/?i=kallang-polyclinic\">Kallang Polyclinic<\/a> and Long-Term Care Facility is a hybrid healthcare building consisting of a long-term care unit with resident patients and a polyclinic offering a wide range of clinical services.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because the design, purpose, and patients treated in each building area are very different and include multiple stakeholders in the decision-making process, construction posed a significant challenge. Every design detail had to pass multiple stages of oversight and approval, so a seamless feedback cycle was essential if project milestones were going to be hit on time.<\/p>\n\n<p>To optimize how information was shared and input received across the extended project team, the company created a 3D digital-collaboration system to bring everyone together.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tiong Seng Contractors created a digital project model and presented it in a virtual reality (VR) environment. The immersive VR experience helped owners and end users, including doctors and nurses, visualize the rooms and provide feedback for faster adjustments and approvals.<\/p>\n\n<p>The immersive VR experience made collaboration between project stakeholders &ldquo;seamless,&rdquo; according to Ye Zaw Lin, corporate BIM manager, Tiong Seng Contractors. &ldquo;We saw a 33% improvement in resolving coordination issues compared to past projects,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\n\n<p>From mechanical and electrical trade contractors to engineers, designers, and the project&rsquo;s clients, every stakeholder could see the latest construction progress and design updates in real time while adding feedback or asking questions.<\/p>\n\n<p>With tighter collaboration and inventive use of 3D-modeling tools, Tiong Seng Contractors reduced the number of prefabricated components needed for the build. That shortened the construction and fabrication timeline by 25% and saved the project more than 5,000 hours.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82Mzg4MDNjZjY3ZDE2LmpwZWcmdmVyc2lvbj0wMDAwJnNpZz1hM2EyMDk4YTgxNzBjNTc4Y2E5ZmVmZGY3MGI1ZGYxOA%253D%253D\" style=\"height:333px; width:700px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h2>Honda: Lightening the Load<\/h2>\n\n<p>In the battle to reduce automotive emissions, targeted design changes can play a crucial role. Decreasing the weight of a car&rsquo;s component parts is an effective way to raise fuel efficiency and lower emissions.<\/p>\n\n<p>In Japan, <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/crankshaft-design\">Honda<\/a> is constantly striving to make cars lighter without sacrificing safety or durability. To reach that goal, the materials used in every bolt and fender have to be scrutinized.<\/p>\n\n<p>That ongoing analysis process led Honda&rsquo;s R&amp;D division to focus efforts on a pilot project aiming at lightening the lowly crankshaft. It&rsquo;s one of the most vital parts of an engine, taking the motion of pistons and redirecting it to make the car move. It has to be strong and resilient. And, traditionally, that&rsquo;s made it heavy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Honda&rsquo;s R&amp;D arm set out to safely reduce the weight of its crankshafts by 30%. The team traveled to the UK, where it received training in generative design and discussed broader topics such as additive manufacturing. The team realized that prototypes could be made from designs quickly.<\/p>\n\n<p>After sharing Honda&rsquo;s weight and operating constraints data, the R&amp;D team then collaborated with design-software experts as the model took shape. Using generative design to virtually test multiple designs and model their efficacy, Honda came up with a design that was miles away from traditional crankshaft forms and materials. The new crankshaft design delivered a 50% weight reduction&mdash;well in excess of the team&rsquo;s 30% reduction goal.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Building Hives of Creativity<\/h2>\n\n<p>Necessity used to be the mother of invention. Today&rsquo;s innovations are just as likely to be sparked by teams working across an ecosystem to achieve a shared business objective. The trend can be seen at every level, from the bottom of the organization to the top.<\/p>\n\n<p>From the first industrial revolution to the fourth, technology has helped people achieve more. Steam made manual tasks easier; electricity and mass production opened the door to automation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, the shift to digital is improving teamwork and knowledge sharing. In Asia-Pacific, those benefits have become vital fuel for innovation.<\/p>\n"},

But that time is here. Welcome to the age of cloud collaboration.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cloud computing is the peak of the digital-transformation journey. As companies increasingly migrate to the cloud, it will:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Enable better, faster decision-making<\/li>\n\t<li>Power the creation of better-performing products, from machines to buildings to entertainment<\/li>\n\t<li>Increase creativity and innovation by eliminating time lost on low-value activities<\/li>\n\t<li>Dramatically increase sustainability and reliability of products<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The cloud can enable <em>real<\/em> collaboration&mdash;enterprise-level collaboration. Sharing the right data with the right people accelerates workflows and creates better decision-making and greater value across the organization.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a closer look at cloud collaboration: where it&rsquo;s been, where it&rsquo;s going, and how it&rsquo;s driving the future of work and transforming industries.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Construction workers collaborating on a cloud-connected platform\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzhhNzBiZTI5YmM4LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWRhMDA1YzBlYWZjOGM0MmRkODhkNDI3ZDY3NmFlYjE5\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">In the cloud, every team member from any industry can collaborate on projects from a single source of truth, a single source of shared data.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-cloud-collaboration\"><strong>What Is Cloud Collaboration?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Cloud collaboration is the ability for people to work together as a virtual team from the same source of information&mdash;the single source of truth&mdash;in one virtual space accessible from a website, a mobile app, or desktop software. Whether it&rsquo;s used to realize a design, project, budget, or analysis, cloud collaboration enables easy data access for the right people at the right time, early and often, regardless of the tool used to author the data. An architect can share a building model; an engineer can review a drawing; a film editor can upload a cut for the director to review.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Cloud collaboration:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Uses digital instead of paper workflows<\/li>\n\t<li>Enables information access and sharing at any time, from anywhere<\/li>\n\t<li>Creates a single source of truth<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Cloud collaboration is much bigger than just sharing files: It&rsquo;s about sharing data. Project- and team-based cloud collaboration are just the first steps. The real &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moment comes through enterprise collaboration, which means everyone in a company works together from a single source of information, dramatically improving a company&rsquo;s value creation for its customers.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"history-of-collaboration\"><strong>History of Collaboration: the Move From Desktops to the Cloud <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Picture the way people used to work together. It was manual, clunky, and inefficient. Long before the cloud was on the horizon, companies often had document-control departments. If you wanted a drawing or a file, you&rsquo;d give a document number to request a printout. And if there were team members in a different location, you raced against the clock to get the files or blueprints to a courier on time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Collaboration became easier with the advent of PDF and JPEG files. However, one still had to save the files on a computer and email entire files to colleagues, who then needed the right software to open them. And the data was locked in these proprietary files. Engineers couldn&rsquo;t just send a new design to the purchasing department for sourcing. They had to plot out a PDF or print a drawing that almost immediately became an outdated, alternate source of truth. If someone made revisions, they had to save a new version. It got confusing fast, with labor spent sorting through multiple incarnations to find the most recent version and making sure everyone was working off the right one. This was version-control hell: working in information silos and workflows that, well, didn&rsquo;t flow.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"A cloud-driven team meeting for digital animation\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzhhNzEyOWEwMDliLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWY2MjA1NGQyMDU0MjBmMDE1NDJiMWY3MGYxNTNkNjE1\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Today&rsquo;s cloud-collaboration tools enable faster, more efficient work, whether in person or remote.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>Then, collaboration software arrived that enabled teams to work together, like building information modeling (<a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/bim-building-information-modeling\">BIM<\/a>) tools. Digital transformation started to happen as companies learned to use the internet to quickly share information. But this created the &ldquo;<em>N<\/em><sup>&nbsp;2<\/sup>&rdquo; problem as information was replicated as it was shared quickly with many more people, resulting in an accelerated version-control hell.<\/p>\n\n<p>The cloud was the answer. In the early 2000s, Amazon and Google released early versions of consumer and corporate clouds. Over time, Microsoft, IBM, Alibaba, and others joined in.&nbsp; Suddenly, data had a place to call home. Cue the 2020 pandemic: Cloud collaboration accelerated like a bullet train as people were forced to work remotely almost overnight. For many companies, the cloud quickly went from a long-range goal to a must-have business strategy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>In 2012, only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.computerworld.com\/article\/2726701\/where-did--cloud--come-from-.html\" target=\"_blank\">20%<\/a> of companies had made major shifts to the cloud.<\/li>\n\t<li>Cloud spending peaked at $410 billion in 2021, a figure that will be surpassed by more than $80 billion in 2022, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2022-04-19-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-end-user-spending-to-reach-nearly-500-billion-in-2022\" target=\"_blank\">Gartner<\/a>. In 2023, cloud revenues are predicted to reach $600 billion.<\/li>\n\t<li>By 2025, it is forecasted that 85% of companies will have shifted to a cloud-first business strategy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"benefits-cloud-computing-collaboration\"><strong>Top 10 Benefits of Cloud Computing and Collaboration <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>The cloud is revolutionizing work, business, and entire industries. Here&rsquo;s how.<\/p>\n\n<h3>1. Better Products&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n<p>Easy access to information&mdash;from most any device, early and often, and by the right people&mdash;gives collaborators full visibility, enabling them to make better decisions at every stage of the process. The result is a more reliable, higher-performing product.<\/p>\n\n<h3>2. Higher Engagement and Productivity<\/h3>\n\n<p>The cloud is an open field with no limit to the number of users. This inclusion empowers people to connect, contribute, and be a part of the collaborative effort, which has a direct impact on engagement and productivity.<\/p>\n\n<h3>3. Increased Sustainability<\/h3>\n\n<p>A cloud-first strategy means sustainability experts can access information early and often, resulting in more sustainable outcomes. The whole team learns and gets a better understanding of how its decisions impact embedded and operating carbon, energy use, and waste.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"An automotive team working on a vehicle body in software\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzhhNzE4NWMwNWI2LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTgyMTE1MGNhNjRjOTRjNGVkM2VhM2VhY2I4ZDkyZjBm\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Working in the cloud benefits manufacturing by reducing waste and rework, enabling greater innovation, speeding up time to market, and more.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h3>4. Greater Innovation&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n<p>Cross-functional teams can work together on projects in real time from any location. Collaboration spurs new ideas, so it&rsquo;s no surprise that innovation will soon account for <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/cloud-based-platforms\">75%<\/a> of the cloud&rsquo;s value. The irony is the pandemic likely reduced innovation among previously face-to-face teams&mdash;but cloud collaboration then dramatically increased the size of the teams and innovation by enabling experts to contribute from around the world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3>5. Lower Costs<\/h3>\n\n<p>The cloud is a more efficient way to work. It consolidates teams, centralizes information, and sheds excess steps, saving time and money. A few other ways it reduces costs include:<\/p>\n\n<h4>Less Waste<\/h4>\n\n<p>Cloud collaboration allows an exchange of information that yields better decisions and fewer mistakes\/less rework.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h4>Shorter Lifecycles<\/h4>\n\n<p>The end-to-end project lifecycle is shorter with cloud collaboration, which reduces labor costs.<\/p>\n\n<h3>6. Faster Time to Market<\/h3>\n\n<p>Wait times are nonexistent in the cloud. People have access to the data they need, whenever they need it. The real-time capabilities move along production and decisions at a faster clip.<\/p>\n\n<h3>7. Increased Safety<\/h3>\n\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s on the shop floor or a construction site, having full visibility at all times enables project managers to better assess risks before production and improve safety during production.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"ZEITDice working at the Autodesk Technology Centre, Toronto\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzhhNzFmMTUxODI3LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTUyOWNjODZhZDhiOTVjM2MwNWMzNGQ2ZWU0NWQ0ZGYw\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Canadian startup ZEITDice makes smart time-lapse cameras that upload to the cloud and analyze data for construction sites and other businesses.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h3>8. Scalability&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n<p>The cloud can easily accommodate business growth and scale as a company gets bigger. Plus, one can quickly reduce costs when business hits a slow period. Aligning costs and value creation is a powerful financial benefit for any business.<\/p>\n\n<h3>9. Meeting and Beating Delivery Times<\/h3>\n\n<p>With greater efficiency and faster time to market enabled by better, faster communications and decision-making, companies can meet (and even beat) deadlines and hit those delivery targets faster than ever.<\/p>\n\n<h3>10. Customer Satisfaction and Success<\/h3>\n\n<p>Getting better products to customers faster is great for business. It means happier end users and greater customer retention. By passing along the benefits of cloud collaboration, you&rsquo;re also contributing to customers&rsquo; success.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>All these benefits culminate in the ultimate goal: higher profitability. <a href=\"https:\/\/sloanreview.mit.edu\/article\/how-leading-organizations-are-getting-the-most-value-from-it\/\" target=\"_blank\">MIT Sloan<\/a> revealed that companies in the top 10% of digital transformation have double the revenue growth of companies in the bottom 25% of that spectrum.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"cloud-can-transform-industries\"><strong>How the Cloud Can Help Transform Industries <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>For individual companies, digital transformation can lead to greater resilience and a competitive edge. But collectively, digital transformation will revolutionize industries. For example, as governments around the world create <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/global-bim\">BIM mandates<\/a> for public projects, companies are accelerating their digital transformations and diving headfirst into the cloud, which is changing the entire architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are the ways digital transformation and cloud-first strategies are benefiting AEC, design and manufacturing, and the media and entertainment industries&mdash;including examples of individual companies that have found great success using the cloud.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Construction workers assessing digital data\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzhhNzIxZDdjODcxLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTg0MmM3YjFiMGYxYjM0NjcxOGFjOTFjMzA2ZTgxMWU5\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Full availability of real-time data from cloud platforms helps the AEC industry by making construction safer and keeping projects on time and on budget.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h3>The Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) Industry<\/h3>\n\n<p>Large construction projects can run <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/~\/media\/McKinsey\/Industries\/Capital%20Projects%20and%20Infrastructure\/Our%20Insights\/The%20next%20normal%20in%20construction\/The-next-normal-in-construction.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">20%<\/a> over schedule and 80% over budget, often due to poor communication. Cloud-based platforms can change that narrative. With cloud collaboration, people have access to the information they need when they need it, which reduces time and cost overruns.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The design-build process is a collaborative journey with many stakeholders requiring design data. Say a customer hires an architect to design a commercial office space. The architect creates a 3D model with the design specs and then shares it with the structural engineer to determine the optimal building structure. The mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) folks offer critical input that positively impacts energy usage. The operations team can have a say in the building&rsquo;s control systems. Finally, the customer can track the design and build process in real time. All of this collaboration happens before construction begins.<\/p>\n\n<p>Working together on a cloud-based platform, teams can see input from others that might impact the design, helping avoid potential problems post-build. For example, if the MEP team decides to put heavy mechanical equipment on the 20th floor, the structural engineer can see the changes and reassess the column size needed to support that extra weight. The civil engineer can recalculate the thickness of the foundation and increase the number of pilings to accommodate this new information.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>From the outside, it might look like too many cooks in the kitchen. But the cloud offers a way to congregate those stakeholders and orchestrate information. Companies that leverage cloud collaboration in construction can:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Spot errors sooner. <\/strong>The more that people have visibility and can provide input on the front end, the fewer changes they&rsquo;ll have to make later, reducing rework.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Help things move faster. <\/strong>That&rsquo;s because&nbsp;each stakeholder can zero in on the information needed.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Save money. <\/strong>Up-front collaboration yields savings in the long run: reduced construction costs with less labor and less waste, quicker delivery times, lower long-term maintenance costs, and decreased energy usage.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Save time on construction schedules. <\/strong>And that means everyone&mdash;both the construction company and the building owner&mdash;makes a higher profit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Finally, cloud-native projects enable a seamless handover to <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/connected-data-for-owners\">building owners<\/a> once construction is complete, so facility teams can access all of that valuable design data to optimize operations, which decreases costs and increases occupant satisfaction while meeting sustainability goals.<\/p>\n\n<h4><strong><strong>Norconsult Forges Large Infrastructure in Norway<\/strong><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p>When design and engineering company Norconsult&nbsp;took on the construction of a <a href=\"https:\/\/forge.autodesk.com\/customer-stories\/nois\">$500 million<\/a>, 19 km road&nbsp;through southern Norway, with 2,000 people involved in the build, it knew that passing paper drawings around would severely slow down the project. Using <a href=\"https:\/\/aps.autodesk.com\/\">Autodesk Platform Services<\/a> (formerly known as Forge), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.norconsult.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Norconsult<\/a> leveraged cloud-based processes to get input from all stakeholders to optimize the design, meet sustainability targets, make data and 3D models accessible from anywhere, and enable easy filtering of BIM content for the various project stakeholders.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h4><strong><strong>Arcadis Upgrades Water Utilities in Ohio<\/strong><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p>Aging infrastructure is a major problem across the United States. When the 70-year-old water- treatment plant in Toledo, OH, was shut down for days due to toxic algae in nearby Lake Erie, it was obvious a system upgrade was desperately needed. Enter global design and engineering company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/customer-stories\/arcadis-water-system-resilience\">Arcadis<\/a>. The company used 3D scans to accurately model the site&rsquo;s existing condition to upgrade six basins and build two more. With these models living in the cloud, the architectural, structural, mechanical, HVAC, electrical, and the civil site teams all worked off one model, which ultimately saved 1,000 design hours.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"BBi Autosport working on a customized Porsche\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzhhNzJiMDM3N2QyLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTZmNGRjMDlhMzMxZjFlYzBkNjQyMmQxMzU5YzNkMDdh\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">BBi Autosport broke down its previous silos of information for designing its customized Porsches by moving its workflow into the centralized Autodek Fusion 360 cloud software.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h3><strong><strong>The Design and Manufacturing Industry<\/strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>The basic premise is the same for manufacturing: the more people with visibility early on, the better the finished product. The design team can share plans with the shop floor so they can understand how to make the product. The fabricators can give design feedback to bring down the manufacturing cost. The purchasing department, which might be halfway around the world, can determine which materials to buy. The maintenance and services teams can give guidance to reduce service and warranty costs. The sales and marketing teams can develop their strategies based on this information and gather customer feedback to adjust future designs for better sales. It&rsquo;s all about giving the right people early access to what&rsquo;s happening up and down the supply chain. And this includes the customer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, I recently had my car worked on at the dealership, and it was a whole new experience. I got play-by-play text messages on the inspection, with photos. Three hours later, I got another message with a problem they found, again with images. Suddenly, it&rsquo;s not a typical customer experience: The dealership had taken me on a journey. The mechanics gave me visibility into their process so I could make more informed decisions.<\/p>\n\n<p>By extending collaboration beyond design and engineering across an entire manufacturing operation and to the customer, people can contribute information that optimizes costs and lowers carbon footprints. This means better products, lower costs, and greater sustainability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Before modern browsers, high-bandwidth connections, and smartphones became ubiquitous, none of this was possible. But with this level of data sharing, it&rsquo;s no longer optional: Cloud collaboration is a necessity that&rsquo;s ushering the industry into a more sustainable, efficient era. And as the Industrial Internet of Things (<a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/iiot-is-where-its-at\">IIoT<\/a>) and <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/automation-in-manufacturing\">automation in manufacturing<\/a> become the norm, the cloud can capture all of that data generated for better decision-making today and tomorrow.<\/p>\n\n<h4><strong><strong>Toshiba Customizes Elevator Design<\/strong><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p>When designing and building an elevator, it&rsquo;s essential to precisely fit the elevator into the structure and understand how it will be used. Previously, the team at <a href=\"https:\/\/forge.autodesk.com\/customer-stories\/toshiba-elevator\">Toshiba<\/a> would have to go back and forth with its customers over several weeks to ensure the design worked in the overall space&mdash;an inefficient and costly process. Now, Toshiba enables its customers to configure their elevators on a web page, automatically creating 3D models on its cloud-based platform. Customers can see exactly what they will get in near real time and easily make changes. The uncertainty of the old process has been eliminated and replaced by customer confidence and delight.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h4><strong><strong>BBi Autosport Makes Bespoke Racers<\/strong><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/fusion-360\/blog\/bbi-autosport-pikes-peak-hoonipigasus\/\">BBi Autosport<\/a>, the need for speed is alive and well. The company designs and customizes one-of-a-kind Porsches for the road and the racetrack. But in past workflows, different teams were working on different parts, separately and siloed even when collaborating on the same vehicle. They shifted to using Autodesk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/fusion-360\/overview\">Fusion 360<\/a>, and it was a game changer. Working together in the cloud streamlined all the moving parts and design data into one centralized hub that allowed simultaneous processes, helping teams reach the finish line faster.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Motion capture at Squeeze Animation Studios\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzhhNzJkYjI1ZTVkLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTRmMWUwY2ZhOWE2NmEyZDUxYzI5NGE2MzJkYjRjYmIx\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Squeeze Animation Studios in Montreal uses the Autodesk cloud platform to manage the immense amount of data it generates from motion capture and other processes.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h3><strong><strong>The Media and Entertainment Industry<\/strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>The media and entertainment industry (M&amp;E) is powered by creative collaboration sessions that have long happened in person&mdash;in the writer&rsquo;s room, on set, or in the edit room. It&rsquo;s also been a linear process, which meant that any changes after the production phase was wrapped often required expensive reshoots.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>A month into storyboarding or character development, a producer might not like the direction of a specific character, forcing designers to scrap their work and start again. And, sometimes, a change might be due to technical issues, like colors that don&rsquo;t work well on 70 mm projectors or for future merchandising.<\/p>\n\n<p>Digital, cloud-based workflows benefit M&amp;E in several ways:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Full visibility across an entire production from the script to screen yields smoother workflows and fewer redesigns and reshoots by letting everyone be involved in the design and preproduction phase.<\/li>\n\t<li>The cloud ensures tighter control over who can see what, where, and when, preventing leaks before the film or product release with better intellectual-property&nbsp;security standards.<\/li>\n\t<li>The cloud provides a platform to review information&mdash;like footage&mdash;in real time and make changes during production instead of after.<\/li>\n\t<li>The cloud aligns the often hundreds of people who work on a single production, game, or product.<\/li>\n\t<li>Instead of bulky film or video, all data is stored in the cloud for more organized asset management and searchable files.<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h4><strong><strong>Amazon Studios Powers the Rings Remotely<\/strong><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p>With 10,000 visual-effects (VFX) shots created by 20 VFX houses,&nbsp;<em>The Rings of Power<\/em> series by Amazon Studios is one of the most complex productions to date&mdash;and it was accomplished by a remote, international workforce. M&amp;E has long been an industry that relies on physical assets, like film reels and digital tapes. But to orchestrate a network of data on increasingly complex projects, Amazon is leveraging the cloud. Software such as Autodesk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/shotgrid\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">ShotGrid<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/solutions\/moxion\">Moxion<\/a> streamlines handoffs from one department to the next and shares footage instantaneously with editors and executives for real-time story edits.<\/p>\n\n<h4><strong><strong>Jellyfish Pictures Collaborates Globally for a Decade<\/strong><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p>The animation and VFX company Jellyfish Pictures is no stranger to the cloud. In fact, the company that has produced work for features such as&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi<\/em> and series such as&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things<\/em> started using the cloud 10 years ago. The teams working in different countries wanted to create one virtual roof under which to work. At the time, there was a lack of quality tools designed for cloud collaboration. Today, Jellyfish uses cloud solutions such as ShotGrid to assign tasks to different teams, break down silos, and coordinate work on shared projects.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Manufacturing engineers analyzing machine data\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzhhNzMxOTUyNjRjLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPThiZWUzOThjNGJkN2MzYmZhM2Q0Y2M1NTBkNzE0NzVk\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The next step for cloud collaboration will take it beyond helping design, engineering, and production to incorporate all business data, such as logistics, financing, and marketing.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"future-of-cloud-collaboration\"><strong>What Is the Future of Cloud Collaboration?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/agenda\/2021\/04\/how-businesses-can-realize-the-benefits-of-the-cloud\/\" target=\"_blank\">90%<\/a> of companies are migrating their workflows to the cloud. That&rsquo;s a great sign, but most are still early in that journey and yet to realize the full power of cloud collaboration. Until now, collaboration tools have focused on teams and projects. Even Autodesk got its start with team collaboration software. But now it&rsquo;s time to think bigger with solutions such as Autodesk&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/bim-360\/construction-document-management-software\/\">BIM 360 Docs<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/construction.autodesk.com\/\">Autodesk Construction Cloud<\/a> to align with the direction that cloud collaboration is headed: enterprise collaboration.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just the design and engineering teams who need access to data. In fact, they&rsquo;re often just 10% of the total cost. Most project costs are for labor, materials, sales, marketing, overhead, and operations. Elevating collaboration from the team to the enterprise level means everyone works from a single source of information, from the onset of a project. From financing to marketing to sales to production, when people have access to the data they need early in the process, they have greater visibility to make better decisions that benefit the entire organization. It&rsquo;s a shift from local design optimization to global optimization for the whole enterprise.<\/p>\n\n<p>This change from just helping the design-and-make process to empowering the larger enterprise is powered by platforms like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/company\/autodesk-platform\">Autodesk Platform Services<\/a> and industry clouds such as Fusion 360 for manufacturing, Autodesk Forma for AEC, and Autodesk Flow for media and entertainment&mdash;connecting&nbsp; people, processes, and data.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>On a project level, cloud collaboration means faster delivery times, lower costs, and greater sustainability. On the enterprise level, it means&nbsp; a leaner, faster organization; happier customers; greater innovation; and higher profits. Cloud collaboration is the glue that makes this a reality for companies, their customers, and entire industries.&nbsp;<\/p>"},

The goal of net zero is to cut carbon emissions to curb climate change to protect the planet and future generations. Human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are a primary driver of climate change&mdash;which, if humans want to mitigate climate impacts to the ecosystem, must be addressed from all perspectives, across all industries.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-embodied-carbon\"><strong>What Is Embodied Carbon?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Embodied carbon in the context of the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry refers to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions released into the atmosphere during the upfront activities necessary to construct or renovate buildings and infrastructure. Reported as carbon-equivalent emissions (CO2e), the total accounting of GHGs emitted during the build phase is called <em>embodied<\/em> <em>carbon<\/em> because the environmental impacts associated with building activities are locked in place prior to building operation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Embodied carbon includes all the upfront activities that are part of construction, as well as any kind of renovation&mdash;replacing a roof, fitting-out a tenant space, or simply replacing carpet or repainting&mdash;activities that also generate GHG emissions. Before the building systems are operating, a carbon footprint has been formed.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong><strong>Operational Carbon<\/strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Energy from fuel-burning activities during building operations can be converted to the metric of <a href=\"https:\/\/spot.ul.com\/blog\/embodied-vs-operational-carbon\/\" target=\"_blank\">operational carbon<\/a>. Operational carbon, therefore, is the amount of GHG emissions released during the operational, or in-use, phase of a building; for example, it can be calculated from energy bills and reported annually. Operational carbon is the carbon-equivalent emissions associated with the operation phase of the building, including heating, cooling, lighting, and power.<\/p>\n\n<p><iframe border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"103\" scroll=\"none\" src=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/hubsFront\/embed_cta\/490498\" width=\"250\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n<h3><strong><strong>Embodied Carbon vs. Operational Carbon<\/strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Many AEC professionals&mdash;everyone from designers and contractors to operators and owners&mdash;understand and focus on reducing operational energy costs due to fuel consumption such as oil, natural gas, or electricity. CO2e generated by the use, management, and maintenance of annual building operations currently account for about 28% of annual global GHG emissions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Relative to operations, CO2e generated by construction activities are accumulated and considered &ldquo;locked-in&rdquo; as embodied carbon before the operational phase. Annually, embodied carbon accounts for close to 11% of global GHG emissions, attributed to the ongoing building activity and construction around the globe. Year over year, this is a significant carbon footprint and a big opportunity for the AEC industry to address associated GHGs beyond operational energy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Stricter building codes, more energy-efficiency equipment and lighting, and more renewable-energy sources will help reduce the operational carbon of buildings. As buildings become more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/insight\/overview\">energy efficient<\/a>, a resulting larger <em>relative<\/em> percentage of a building&rsquo;s total CO2e impact will be the upfront embodied carbon. As part of the design and renovate process, AEC professionals have the ability to influence and reduce carbon impacts in the built environment. Recognizing the role that embodied carbon plays relative to the total CO2e is key to identifying how the AEC industry can help mitigate the climate crisis by reducing its carbon footprint.<\/p>\n\n<figure><strong><img alt=\"two workers stand in an empty office with a graphic overlay of coming systems\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82Mzk3ODU2M2FiZmZmLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWM4NTU2NmRjODhkZjcxMjczYzRmODBlODUwOTU1NmNl\" \/> <\/strong>\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Embodied carbon includes upfront construction activities that take place before building systems begin operating; operational carbon includes emissions associated with the building operation phase.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h3><strong><strong>Total Carbon <\/strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Measuring the embodied and predicted operational carbon impacts of a building is one way the AEC industry can estimate and quantify the potential environmental impact of a building or other aspect of the built environment in the planning and design phases, long before it is built.<\/p>\n\n<p>One benefit is the ability to compare and make informed trade-offs between embodied and operational carbon associated with design decisions. For example, imagine you want to compare the total carbon of a window type for a new building design. You could evaluate the trade-offs between double- versus triple-pane insulated glazing units and compare the long-term operational energy and carbon savings of the higher-performing triple-pane window versus the upfront embodied carbon of sourcing more glass and other raw materials necessary to install a triple-pane window. In some cases, the energy savings of the better-performing window over an estimated building lifespan may not offset the embodied carbon of the window itself. The ability to evaluate total carbon impacts of both embodied and operational carbon during the design process can enable optimization and reduction of potential contributions to GHG emissions.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong><strong>Whole-Life Carbon<\/strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Whole-life carbon expands on the total carbon concept. In addition to the upfront embodied carbon, it includes the ongoing, year-over-year GHG emission impacts associated with an asset&rsquo;s use-phase activities (annual energy consumption, maintenance, repair), as well as the refurbishment, dismantling, salvage, reuse, and demolition activities across an asset&rsquo;s end-of-life phase. This whole-life assessment is often called &ldquo;cradle to grave&rdquo; because it is a cumulative accounting of all environmental impacts across the asset lifecycle.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-the-AEC-industry-contributes-to-GHG-emissions\"><strong>How the AEC Industry Contributes to GHG Emissions<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>The built world includes living, working, and recreational spaces made up of buildings, roads, bridges, and transportation and distribution systems (for example, utilities). The everyday operations of these human-made systems affect the world&rsquo;s ecosystem and contribute to climate change. The AEC industry yields significant influence over the planning, design, construction, and operations of the built environment. Notably, the building sector is one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/architecture2030.org\/why-the-building-sector\/\" target=\"_blank\">biggest contributors<\/a> to GHG emissions, which cause global warming. Given this influence, the AEC industry is poised to adopt more sustainable practices and lead cross-industry decarbonization efforts to reduce its impact on climate change.<\/p>\n\n<p>To fully understand how the AEC industry contributes to GHG emissions, it is useful to first think about the lifecycle phases of a built asset, such as a building, and the related activities of each:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Plan and design: First, a building must be planned and designed, to be fit for a purpose.<\/li>\n\t<li>Build: From idea to reality, the build phase is the construction of a building, including procurement and transport of building materials to the construction site for assembly.<\/li>\n\t<li>Operate: The longest phase, daily operations, often powered by electricity, is necessary for a building to serve its purpose for years, decades, perhaps centuries.<\/li>\n\t<li>Renovate: Extending its life, a building may be renewed or renovated for an extended operations phase and ultimately be demolished in its final phase.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<figure><strong><img alt=\"a construction worker checks materials with an iPad\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82Mzk3ODc1NTFhODg4LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWE3MWFkYmJmM2ZkNTI4MDI5ODIxYTRiMTVkZjA5MDcw\" \/> <\/strong>\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">In the build phase of a building, greenhouse gas emissions are released during materials manufacturing and transportation and on-site construction activities.<\/figcaption>\n<strong> <\/strong><\/figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/ghgemissions\/overview-greenhouse-gases\" target=\"_blank\">Greenhouse gas emissions<\/a> are released primarily during the build and operate phases of a building and are typically caused by fuel-burning activities such as raw-material extraction processes (for example, extraction of iron ore to make steel); manufacturing and transportation of building materials, products, and systems; and on-site construction activities.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once operating, GHGs are emitted as byproducts of heating and cooling a building. These building activities release various gases&mdash;primarily nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and fluorinated gases&mdash;for which the cumulation of these gases strengthens the greenhouse effect. The majority is CO2, and the other gases can be equated to impacts associated with CO2 by calculating their <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Global_warming_potential\" target=\"_blank\">Global Warming Potential<\/a> (a method to measure the climate effects of different gases); the combined effects are accumulated as carbon-equivalent emissions (CO2e).<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-governments-and-AEC-firms-can-help-reduce-embodied-carbon\"><strong>How Governments and AEC Firms Can Help Reduce Embodied Carbon<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>With the world population expected to hit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.un.org\/en\/desa\/world-population-projected-reach-98-billion-2050-and-112-billion-2100\" target=\"_blank\">9.8 billion in 2050<\/a>, there will naturally be an increase in construction to keep pace with housing, infrastructure, and services for this growth. <a href=\"https:\/\/architecture2030.org\/why-the-building-sector\/\" target=\"_blank\">By 2060<\/a>, the global building floor area is expected to double in size. And with this estimated increase in construction, there will be an increase in global GHG emissions attributable to the AEC industry. Here&#39;s how governments are helping.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong><strong>Government Commitments and Regulations<\/strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>To mitigate climate change and meet 1.5-degree-Celsius climate targets put forth in the <a href=\"https:\/\/unfccc.int\/process-and-meetings\/the-paris-agreement\/the-paris-agreement\" target=\"_blank\">Paris Agreement<\/a>, CO2 emissions need to be eliminated from the built environment by 2040. This will take a concerted effort by all governments as well as other stakeholders&mdash;working both internally and cooperatively with other countries&mdash;and an increase in meaningful corporate commitments and actions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Around the world, governments are committing to environmental targets, such as net-zero emissions. To meet these commitments, governments are instituting programs and regulations that will require AEC professionals to act and report on carbon impacts associated with designing, building, or renovating the built environment.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/treasury-board-secretariat\/services\/innovation\/greening-government\/strategy.html\" target=\"_blank\">Government of Canada has committed to net-zero emissions by 2050<\/a>, which means policies will be put in place to decarbonize the operations of government-owned property, mobility, and other programs. Another example is Denmark, which has <a href=\"https:\/\/passivehouseplus.co.uk\/news\/general\/denmark-sets-out-phased-embodied-carbon-targets-for-buildings\" target=\"_blank\">put forth a set of policies<\/a> for the phasing of embodied carbon targets to reduce embodied CO2 emissions and operational CO2 emissions for buildings. Some jurisdictions are instituting local regulations to decarbonize, such as Marin County, California, which stipulates compliance with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marincounty.org\/depts\/cd\/divisions\/sustainability\/low-c\" target=\"_blank\">low-carbon concrete requirements<\/a> in construction. These examples are just a few of the growing efforts put forth by regulatory agencies and government organizations around the world to decarbonize the AEC industry.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong><strong>Inflation Reduction Act<\/strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>One policy that will have a <a href=\"https:\/\/adsknews.autodesk.com\/views\/embodied-carbon-ira-cop27\">significant influence<\/a> in the United States is the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.energy.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2022-08\/8.18%20InflationReductionAct_Factsheet_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Inflation Reduction Act<\/a> (IRA). It&rsquo;s the largest federal climate investment in US history, signed into law on August 16, 2022, by President Joe Biden.

This, combined with state action and upcoming federal regulations, puts the nation within reach of its commitment to cut emissions by 50%&ndash;52%, per the Paris Climate Agreement, by 2030. Notably, the IRA allocates almost $4.5 billion toward measuring embodied carbon in construction materials and installing low-carbon products in public infrastructure and federal government buildings.<\/p>\n\n<figure><strong><img alt=\"an architect works on a building design on her computer\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82Mzk3ODgzMTJmOTI5LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWU0MmViZDNjNzUyNGVlMTBhZDVjNzAxY2MwMGZmZTA5\" \/> <\/strong>\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Providing AEC professionals with transparent data enables them to make carbon-reducing design choices.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"5-ways-the-AEC-industry-can-help-in-reducing-embodied-carbon\"><strong>5 Ways the AEC Industry Can Help in Reducing Embodied Carbon<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>The AEC industry&rsquo;s contribution to GHG emissions is undeniable, and the sector is shifting its focus toward more environmentally responsible building practices. Innovation plays a key role in this shift. By prioritizing the right design strategies and adopting more <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/sustainable-construction\">sustainable construction<\/a> methods, companies can turn good intentions into positive action.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong><strong>1. Make Data More Transparent <\/strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>A key to better understanding embodied carbon&rsquo;s role in the built world is transparency of the environmental impact of materials and processes used in all upstream activities. Providing transparent data, with measured and verified environmental impact, gives AEC professionals the opportunity to make better decisions about how and with what they&rsquo;re building. For example, embodied carbon can be reduced by comparing data for building products and choosing lower embodied carbon products or <a href=\"https:\/\/carbonleadershipforum.org\/carbon-storing-materials\/\" target=\"_blank\">carbon-sequestering materials<\/a>. Furthermore, if AEC professionals demand more transparent data&mdash;asking manufacturers to report metrics and measurement of environmental impact, for example&mdash;they could drive change and foster industry transformation, ultimately accelerating decarbonization of the AEC industry.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong><strong>2. Implement Design-Optimization Tools <\/strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>There are many resources available to help AEC professionals understand the environmental impact of building materials and compare material data sources to make informed decisions. There are design optimization tools specific to product and material data, which can aid an AEC professional in exploring, comparing, and selecting building materials. These tools help make sense of the data available and can be used to evaluate various environmental factors associated with the building products and materials, as part of the comprehensive evaluation for other design criteria, such as performance, durability, maintenance, and aesthetics. As one part of a designer&rsquo;s toolkit, optimization tools can leverage material data transparency to enable informed design decisions, empowering the AEC industry to consider sustainability as part of the design and build process.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, by comparing material data, designers and contractors can choose more sustainable materials for their projects, such as concrete mixes that have lower embodied carbon, more sustainably manufactured steel, and recycled or carbon-sequestering materials such as wood. Many design-optimization tools enable this process by quantifying the CO2e of materials and products.<\/p>\n\n<p>Integrating these capabilities into building information modeling (<a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/bim-building-information-modeling\">BIM<\/a>) workflows can help streamline this exploratory process for AEC professionals. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buildingtransparency.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Building Transparency<\/a> is a US-based organization that not only manages a robust and growing dataset on embodied carbon data for materials but also helped developed BIM-connected solutions that are transforming the toolbox used by AEC professionals to enable the design optimization of sustainable building materials. Below are a few software solutions that enable design optimization to reduce embodied carbon:<\/p>\n\n<h4>Carbon Insights<\/h4>\n\n<p>The Carbon Insights feature in <a href=\"https:\/\/insightX.autodesk.com\/oneenergy\">Autodesk Insight<\/a>, currently available as a technology preview in Revit, provides architects the ability to conduct early-phase embodied-carbon analysis of building exterior walls. Carbon Insights is a cloud-based service that leverages material embodied carbon data from Building Transparency&rsquo;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buildingtransparency.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator<\/a>&nbsp;(EC3) dataset.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h4><strong><strong>Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator (EC3)<\/strong><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/embodied-carbon-calculator\">EC3<\/a> is a free, open-access tool that helps measure embodied carbon in building materials&mdash;a hidden contributor to carbon emissions. The cloud-based tool includes a searchable global database of thousands of building products, pulling third-party-verified data from Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs). Leveraging this database, EC3 can assess and benchmark embodied carbon of building material quantities from construction estimates and\/or BIM models. Architects, engineers, and contractors can input their project-specific data and then compare the carbon intensity from available materials. This open and transparent database will continually improve as both Building Transparency and EC3 users continue to add more EPDs to the dataset. With EC3 data, AEC professionals can make more informed choices, opting for materials that have a lower environmental impact.<\/p>\n\n<h4><strong><strong>TallyLCA<\/strong><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p>TallyLCA is an Autodesk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/autodesk-university\/article\/Using-Revit-and-Dynamo-Assess-Embodied-Carbon-2021\">Revit<\/a> plug-in that enables architects to conduct <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lifecycleinitiative.org\/starting-life-cycle-thinking\/life-cycle-approaches\/life-cycle-sustainability-assessment\/\" target=\"_blank\">Life Cycle Assessments<\/a> (LCAs&mdash;analyses of the potential environmental impacts of products or services during their entire life cycle) of their BIM data. Intended to be used in early-phase design to make building-system design decisions, Tally enables cross-category and cross-system LCA comparisons based on a customized dataset. This gives architects the power to conduct LCAs to make major building-system decisions during the design and planning phase and, later in the procurement phase, optimize for embodied carbon of the system by comparing specific products of a category or system using EC3. While TallyLCA assesses whole-life carbon of building systems, EC3 calculates <em>embodied<\/em> carbon impacts associated with specific products, a decision that can be made later in the procurement phase.<\/p>\n\n<h4><strong><strong>TallyCAT<\/strong><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n<p>Tally Climate Action Tool, currently in beta, is a Revit plug-in that enables real-time data connection between a Revit model and the EC3 tool. This enables embodied carbon assessment of building products and materials while designing with BIM and supports the specification for low-carbon materials during procurement.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong><strong>3. Use an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD)<\/strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Not all product and material data are equal. Therefore, to ensure a quality and fair comparison of two materials, referencing third-party-verified data that&rsquo;s been vetted by a scientifically based and globally accepted methodology is critical. An EPD reports environmental data based on an LCA of the individual material that was independently verified according to International Standards Organization (ISO) 14040 and ISO 14044. ISO sets the global baseline and benchmark for EPD data&mdash;not only for the AEC industry but also for all material data.<\/p>\n\n<p>An EPD provides transparent data about the environmental impact associated with the making of, and sometimes the use of, a material or product. When it comes to understanding impact and making choices, a material EPD is similar to a food nutrition label, which displays the ingredients and health effects of that food item. This information can be used to inform decisions about designing with that material.<\/p>\n\n<figure><strong><img alt=\"architects work on a stadium design\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82Mzk3ODk0NjY5Yjg2LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWI0M2Y2NDYzZDI4NTU5MWUzODM5M2Q3MTgyZTNiM2Q3\" \/> <\/strong>\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Giving stakeholders access to common data and collaborative tools leads to more sustainable project outcomes.<\/figcaption>\n<strong> <\/strong><\/figure>\n\n<h3><strong><strong>4. Ensure Design <\/strong><strong>Collaboration and Data Access<\/strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Enabling easy collaboration and access to common data during early-phase planning through to detailed design and procurement also helps the AEC industry reduce embodied carbon emissions. For example, when all stakeholders are working in the cloud and using a tool such as BIM on their projects, everyone has access to and is informed by the same information. Embodied carbon associated with building materials and products is one of many forms of data that can be integrated into BIM and inform the decision-making process. When stakeholders evaluate and compare products and material selections before procurement to determine the best building practices and materials for the environment, it leads to more sustainable outcomes.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong><strong>5. Reuse, Repurpose, and Upgrade Existing Building Stock<\/strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Existing buildings are an important resource because the embodied carbon emissions are already embedded and locked in place for many years. Avoiding demanding more raw materials and resources is one part of the solution. Seeking opportunities to repurpose and reuse existing building stock will minimize landfill waste and demand for new resources. This reduces embodied carbon that otherwise would have been attributed to building new structures.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"2-examples-of-reduced-embodied-carbon-in-the-built-world\"><strong>2 Examples of Reduced Embodied Carbon in the Built World<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>A growing number of AEC firms are doing their part to offset global carbon emissions, and it all starts with how they&rsquo;re designing and building. Using a variety of methods to decarbonize their buildings, these firms understand that embodied carbon is a key metric that must be measured and reduced.<\/p>\n\n<figure><strong><img alt=\"The 1 De Haro building in San Francisco\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82Mzk3OGEzMzFiOThmLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTY2ZTI5OWEwOGFjM2RkMDk0NTQxOTM0OWE0MmJiMDhm\" \/> <\/strong>\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">1 De Haro in San Francisco is the first multistory mass-timber structure in California.

What makes this 134,000-square-foot project unique is its <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/mass-timber\">mass-timber<\/a> structure. Using a combination of CLT and glue-laminated timber (GLT), global design practice Perkins&amp;Will created a building that&rsquo;s more lightweight, sustainable, and aesthetically appealing than a traditional steel or concrete building.<\/p>\n\n<p>Perkins&amp;Will used TallyLCA to measure the embodied carbon and discovered a massive savings in the CLT system over a comparable <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/concrete-and-steel-alternatives\">concrete and steel<\/a> building&mdash;more than 3,500 metric tons of CO2, to be exact. Additionally, thanks to using prefabrication methods of mass timber, the embodied carbon sequestered in the structure will offset 15 to 20 years of operational energy use.<\/p>\n\n<h3><strong><strong>Reducing Microsoft&rsquo;s Footprint in Redmond, WA<\/strong><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>When Microsoft redeveloped its 500-acre <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/embodied-carbon-calculator\">headquarters<\/a> in Redmond, WA, it was committed to going beyond designing for building energy efficiency. It looked for ways to reduce the associated carbon footprint of every single building material. The company knew that building new came with a hidden environmental impact: embodied carbon.<\/p>\n\n<p>With 17 new buildings and 2.5 million square feet of new workspace, project stakeholders understood the importance of reducing embodied carbon to meet Microsoft&rsquo;s stated environmental targets. To this end, they used the EC3 tool to reduce embodied carbon by as much as 30%. Using EC3, Microsoft was able to prioritize reductions in key areas where the new building materials would otherwise have had high embodied carbon emissions.<\/p>\n\n<figure><strong><img alt=\"a rendering of a new Microsoft campus in Washington\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82Mzk3OGI2NzdlN2E4LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPThjMWZkMjFjOGY2MDJmYTYxM2ZkM2EzZTcwOWI4YjJj\" \/> <\/strong>\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Microsoft used the EC3 tool to reduce embodied carbon by as much as 30%. Courtesy of Microsoft.<\/figcaption>\n<strong> <\/strong><\/figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-does-the-future-hold-for-the-AEC-industry-and-embodied-carbon\"><strong>What Does the Future Hold for the AEC Industry and Embodied Carbon?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s a paradigm shift happening in the AEC industry: Design professionals are taking on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aia.org\/pages\/150126-how-materials-transparency-affects-your-pra\" target=\"_blank\">new role<\/a> that prioritizes climate-change initiatives and assumes more responsibility for how their projects in the built environment impact the planet.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, architects and designers have access to more data and more design-optimization tools to make informed decisions about the materials and products going into our buildings and infrastructure. Today, the AEC industry can evaluate and choose environmentally responsible building materials, more than ever before. With this new way of working and access to common data, AEC professionals can be more discerning about the manufacturers they work with and from whom they select materials, such as giving preference to those that exhibit the most product transparency.<\/p>\n\n<p>By working with businesses that disclose the environmental impacts of their products, design professionals can make sound choices that help reduce embodied carbon as well as other environmental considerations. Possessing a better understanding of how building products interact with the environment, through transparent data, enables them to go a step further by eliminating harmful substances and practices altogether. Early planning and evaluation of materials for environmental attributes such as embodied carbon can drive the greatest sustainable impact.<\/p>\n\n<figure><strong><img alt=\"two construction workers check data on iPads\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82Mzk3OGMxZGEzNzljLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWMxNmE5NWY4ZGU0MmRkNzRkYmNmMzg4NmZlMDAxYmQ5\" \/> <\/strong>\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Technology has the power to drive the planet toward a net-zero economy.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>Governments around the world are beginning to incentivize or implement building regulations to help reduce embodied carbon. AEC professionals and firms alike are beginning to make stronger commitments to reduce their carbon footprint in the built environment. The effects of climate change affect everyone&mdash;and <em>everything<\/em>&mdash;on Earth, and the movement toward building for a more sustainable, cleaner future is growing. Data is key to understanding the effects of embodied carbon in the built environment, but it&rsquo;s not just about gathering the data; it&rsquo;s also about understanding what it means and how it affects every structure and every product.<\/p>\n\n<p>With these forces of change, the AEC industry is poised to standardize and connect&nbsp;material and product data for embodied carbon with data from authoring tools such as BIM. Combining built-environment data in this way enables AEC professionals to make informed design decisions and empowers them to make more sustainable material selections.<\/p>\n\n<p>Technology is already a key enabler of climate change mitigation, and when properly harnessed, it has the power to drive the planet toward a net-zero economy. And it could happen even sooner than anticipated. With the right powerful tools and a growing awareness of embodied carbon in construction, a more sustainable tomorrow is well within reach.<\/p>\n"},

Passively attuning a building to its climatic conditions means considering the orientation of building design and elements to modulate daylighting exposure, natural ventilation, and placement of thermal mass, as well as insulation to reduce energy demand before planning for any active systems or energy-generation strategies. &ldquo;The best designs&nbsp;end up as a really interesting combination of passive design strategies and a high-tech understanding of it through analysis,&rdquo; she says.<\/p><p>Deploying low-tech passive design strategies can align designers with building forms that are more closely tied to the culture as well as the climate of a place. For Short, this means leaning into the Maori concept of <a href=\"https:\/\/teara.govt.nz\/en\/kaitiakitanga-guardianship-and-conservation\/page-4\" target=\"_blank\">Kaitiaki<\/a>: a commitment to ecological guardianship, protection, and conservation.<\/p><p>In practical terms, this means collaborating with the local Maori people who have <em>mana whenua<\/em> status (authority over the land) to understand and respond better to the natural, cultural, and sacred history of the place. There are also many examples of traditional building techniques that respond to the climate, which designers can look to learn from and apply to the contemporary built environment.<\/p><p>&ldquo;One simple&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wildernessmag.co.nz\/10-of-the-best-pa-sites-in-new-zealand\/\" target=\"_blank\">example<\/a> that I quite like is if you go to an old p\u0101 site, which is a traditional Maori village, there&rsquo;ll be numerous pits dug into the ground,&rdquo; Short says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s used to store food at a stable cool temperature, similar to a root cellar. Maori used the mass of the ground to extract the heat out of the space so you can keep things cool with a small structure over the top to keep it shady. This passive design uses ventilation and mass to maintain a suitable temperature for vegetables but also can be applied as a design strategy to keep an environment comfortable for people.&rdquo;<\/p><figure><img alt=\"A rendering of the Heke Hua Archives New Zealand building\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2FlMjRkYWJkMWVmLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWRkODAwNjFmODU3NzBhNDFmMWQ5MGZkZWExMjg0YjI5\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A rendering of the Heke Hua Archives New Zealand building, co-designed with Maori <em>mana whenua<\/em> representatives.

The formal expression has been co-designed with Maori <em>mana whenua<\/em> representatives and design agency Tihei working alongside Warren and Mahoney and DIA to articulate a Maori world view. The building will store more than 7 million records and national treasures (aka <em>taonga<\/em> to the Maori people).<\/p><p>Because the building will sit on the historic site for the Pipitea P\u0101, predating the European settlement in Wellington Harbour, Warren and Mahoney took care to tell the story of the indigenous people in the building design. &ldquo;That building has had a really successful engagement process where a lot of the stories of the site, and the treasures it holds, are expressed in the design of the facade, working with artists to tell those stories through patterns and form-making of the facades,&rdquo; Short says. &ldquo;When you look at the building, you can start to understand the stories, why it&rsquo;s there, what it holds, and what it means to people.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Due to the nature of the treasures housed in the building, the environmental performance for heat and humidity is paramount. The building uses a combination of a highly tuned building fabric and advanced active systems to ensure the contents are protected for generations to come. Like the food storage pit, Heke Hua Archives utilizes exposed thermal mass to maintain a stable environment and reduce the use of mechanical air conditioning.<\/p><p>As Short and Warren and Mahoney look more extensively into the indigenous ways of building, it becomes more apparent that the carbon story of a building and the story of the people and the place are really two sides of the same coin. &ldquo;When we design in response to the climate, we inherently get buildings that are low carbon,&rdquo; Short says.&nbsp;&ldquo;The stories of place can ideally inspire the whole concept of the building, how people might use it, and how people would relate to it.&rdquo;<\/p>"},

Since the 1950s, humans have created more than 8 billion metric tons of it, according to researchers from the University of Georgia. In a 2017 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eurekalert.org\/news-releases\/666078\" target=\"_blank\">study<\/a>, the school reported that in the past 60 years, only 9% of plastic has been recycled; 79% has ended up in landfills or the natural environment. If these trends continue, roughly 12 billion metric tons of plastic waste will be in landfills or the environment by 2050.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>To save the planet from pollution and climate change, it&rsquo;s time to get serious about recycling&mdash;not only bottles, boxes, and bags but also buildings, says Pete Collard, exhibitions curator at the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Royal Institute of British Architects (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.architecture.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">RIBA<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Like many other industries, architecture, engineering, and construction has followed a linear path: We consume materials; we make a product; then, we throw that product away and buy a new one. That&rsquo;s not sustainable,&rdquo; says Collard, whose <a href=\"https:\/\/www.architecture.com\/explore-architecture\/exhibitions\/Long-Life-Low-Energy\" target=\"_blank\">exhibition<\/a> titled <em>Long Life, Low Energy: Designing for a Circular Economy<\/em> debuted at RIBA&rsquo;s London headquarters in November 2022. The collaboration between RIBA and Autodesk, which is sponsoring the exhibition through April 1, 2023, demonstrates how circular economy principles can help create more sustainable, net-zero architecture.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"The \u201cLong Life, Low  Energy: Designing for a Circular Economy\u201d exhibit\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2MxYzQxYzAyYjgzLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWU0M2I2ZGRlNTZmMzMxMTBkMWJiYjA2NzIyYmMyMDgy\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The <em>Long Life, Low Energy: Designing for a Circular Economy<\/em> exhibit, a collaboration between RIBA and Autodesk. Courtesy of Agnese Santivo\/RIBA.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Land has value, and there increasingly is great financial gain in knocking down existing buildings to build new ones,&rdquo; Collard says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re proposing that your starting point should always be to reuse. You can always build something new, but it&rsquo;s so much better to use the existing building or components and materials found within it. In doing so, you can stop the use of virgin materials and avoid filling landfills. When you knock down buildings, you create a hell of a lot of waste.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Adopting circular economy principles isn&rsquo;t just sustainable&mdash;it&rsquo;s strategic. The global population reached 8 billion in November 2022, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.un.org\/en\/desa\/world-population-reach-8-billion-15-november-2022\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations<\/a>, which expects that number to reach nearly 10 billion by 2050. This increase will require the global construction industry to build an average of <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/infographics\/building-the-future\" target=\"_blank\">13,000 new buildings<\/a> every day. Facing challenges like supply chain interruptions and labor shortages, it&rsquo;s unclear how the industry will keep up.<\/p>\n\n<p>Relying only on new construction, it might not. &ldquo;Circular&rdquo; design and construction&mdash;restoration, renovation, retrofit, and reuse&mdash;is an economic and environmental imperative.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Obviously, there are serious climate issues happening right now,&rdquo; Collard says. &ldquo;The world is waking up to the harmful legacy of previous generations &hellip; as a result, we as an industry need to put more thought into what materials we use and the ways we design and build.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>As RIBA&rsquo;s exhibition illustrates, a growing number of architecture firms are doing exactly that. Using technology solutions that make reuse increasingly viable, they&rsquo;re forging a new legacy with innovative projects showcasing the potential the circular economy offers the built environment.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Phoenix House Rises From Storied Ashes<\/h2>\n\n<p>Among the projects featured in <em>Long Life, Low Energy<\/em> is CSK Architects&rsquo; <a href=\"https:\/\/cskarchitects.co.uk\/houses-phoenix-house-1\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenix House<\/a> in Windsor, England. Set for completion in 2024, it&rsquo;s located on the historic site of an 18th-century mansion, home to two former British prime ministers. One former owner, Sir Frances Barry, acquired the house in 1872 and called it St. Leonard&rsquo;s Hill. When Barry died in the 1920s, his disgruntled son&mdash;with whom he had a thorny relationship&mdash;wanted to sell the house but couldn&rsquo;t. So he peppered it with dynamite and blew it up. Its scattered remains have rested on a picturesque hill overlooking Windsor Castle ever since.<\/p>\n\n<p>Current owner Andrew Try commissioned CSK to build on the foundations of the old structure, using reclaimed materials salvaged from the carcass of St. Leonard&rsquo;s Hill. The finished product will be a net-zero courtyard house with a U-shaped design incorporating the historic stone portico&mdash;the only part of the original mansion still intact.<\/p>\n\n<p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/565565041?h=2e1a4b4e6d\" width=\"640\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The bit that&rsquo;s left from the original house is like a fragment of DNA, and in a weird sort of Frankenstein way, we&rsquo;re taking that fragment of DNA and using it to regrow a new house,&rdquo; says architect Matthew Barnett Howland, director of research and development at CSK. &ldquo;You have this site where there have been a couple of buildings over a few hundred years, and it&rsquo;s blown up by dynamite. You come along and collect all those bits, and you put them back together to build something new. &hellip; It&rsquo;s quite an unusual project.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Working with the Bartlett School of Architecture at University College London, CSK excavated stones from the site, cleaned and numbered them, and made 3D digital scans to create a &ldquo;digital quarry&rdquo; of salvaged materials. Using design software, architects can mix and match stones from this digital inventory, determining how to reassemble them for aesthetic and structural integrity as if playing a game of virtual Jenga. The team used this process to design and build a prototype: a trabeated stone portal that mixes rough, organic stones with smooth ones cut into six-sided blocks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our stonemason said they typically work on a 30% reuse proportion&rdquo; Howland says.&nbsp;&ldquo;So if they receive a ton of stone, they can hope to use one-third of a ton in the final building. Through this more careful process, we were able to increase that to 50%.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"A digital quarry of scanned rocks.\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2MxYzYxMjMwM2RiLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTQ5OTc2NmQ1Mjk2NTFhZjEyMjYxNDU5YTZiYmQ0YzA3\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stones were cleaned, numbered, and 3D scanned to create a &ldquo;digital quarry&rdquo; for use in Phoenix House.

In the case of Phoenix House, it&rsquo;s a little bit of both.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p><iframe border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"103\" scroll=\"none\" src=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/hubsFront\/embed_cta\/486525\" width=\"250\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n<h2>Battersea Power Station as Net-Zero Prototype<\/h2>\n\n<p>Also showcased in <em>Long Life, Low Energy<\/em> is the <a href=\"https:\/\/batterseapowerstation.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">Battersea Power Station<\/a>.&nbsp;Located on the River Thames in London, it&rsquo;s a coal-fired power station built in the 1930s, expanded in the 1950s, decommissioned in 1983, and reopened in 2022 after several failed redevelopment attempts. Once dingy and derelict, it&rsquo;s now a mixed-use building that includes a large public park, high-end offices, flats, restaurants, shops, a health club, and a chic hotel.<\/p>\n\n<p>Encompassing 42 acres, the project has attracted high-profile office tenants such as Apple and retailers including Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren. Architects, historians, and environmentalists have applauded the decision to reimagine the Battersea Power Station instead of razing it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Led by architects at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wilkinsoneyre.com\/projects\/battersea-power-station\" target=\"_blank\">WilkinsonEyre<\/a>, the vision was to create a modern space while respecting the substance, style, and scale established by the building&rsquo;s original architects, Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and J. Theo Halliday. The <a href=\"https:\/\/batterseapowerstation.co.uk\/about\/heritage-safeguarding-our-heritage\/\" target=\"_blank\">results<\/a> are evident at every turn.<\/p>\n\n<p>Take the four iconic white chimneys. They were structurally unsound, so crews painstakingly dismantled them and then carefully rebuilt them to the original specifications using the original construction methods from the 1930s and 1950s. Now, visitors can view them from inside through a giant glass ceiling in the South Atrium, or they can take Lift 109, an innovative glass elevator, to the top for exquisite views of London&rsquo;s skyline.<\/p>\n\n<p>Or there are the 6 million bricks that constituted the building&rsquo;s original structure, many of which were weathered and damaged. To restore them, Battersea Power Station Development Company (BPSDC) located the two brickmakers of the Power Station&rsquo;s original masonry and commissioned 1.75 million new hand-thrown bricks to match.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"The Battersea Station exterior\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2MxYzZhYTZkZDYwLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTc2ZWJlZjY0NjliODJjMzAyOWJjYWY3NGY4NWEyOWYz\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Battersea Power Station&mdash;built in the 1930s, decommissioned in 1983, and reopened in 2022&mdash; preserves original elements, including the building&rsquo;s iconic chimneys.

Turbine Hall A has been fully restored to its original art deco glory, featuring an old gantry crane, as well as footprints of the old turbine machinery laid in brick on the floor. In Turbine Hall B, the dials and switches in an old control room have been turned into decor for a 1950s-themed bar, Control Room B.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We reused as much of the existing fabric within the Power Station as possible,&rdquo; says Sebastien Ricard, project director at WilkinsonEyre. &ldquo;Where new materials were required, we sourced these from the UK, where we could help reduce the carbon footprint. In many cases, the existing fabric was kept in an &lsquo;as found&rsquo; condition, albeit strengthened with the necessary structures, to keep the quirks and abnormalities that tell the building&rsquo;s history.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>To successfully execute the project&rsquo;s many elements, the team conducted an extensive 3D point cloud survey of the existing structure, created 2D and 3D models using CAD software and Autodesk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/revit\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">Revit<\/a>, and overlayed the newer elements of construction on top of its models.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Technology has the advantage of putting all the various parties in construction in simultaneous receipt of information, working in parallel rather than in series,&rdquo; Ricard says. &ldquo;[Building information modeling]&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/bim-building-information-modeling\">BIM<\/a> is transformative because it allows coordination of information during design stages, evaluating the impacts of different scenarios, and meaningfully testing sustainability strategies during the development process.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Inside a renovated control room at Battersea Power Station\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2MxYzdkNTAxODRmLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWNlYzczMTU0YmJjMzA0NjUyNThhYmVhNTYwMDYwN2M2\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Inside the Battersea complex, an old control room with original dials and switches was transformed into a 1950s-themed bar.

The contractors, architects, and engineers worked from a 3D digital model of the whole project for every stage of construction.<\/p>\n\n<h2>A Rather Significant Shift in Mindset<\/h2>\n\n<p>Collard hopes that Phoenix House, Battersea Power Station, and similar projects will inspire a new generation of architects to build differently&mdash;starting with materials.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The idea of the circular economy is not new, but the materials used in <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/prefabrication-and-modern-construction-methods\">modern construction<\/a> don&rsquo;t traditionally lend themselves to the process of dismantling and reusing,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Funny enough, the older the building is, the more recyclable or reusable it can be. If you go to Rome, for example, there are so many buildings from the Roman Empire still standing because they were built with blocks of stone, and stone lasts forever. &hellip; In ancient European cities, it was common for those stone blocks to be disassembled and reused in new buildings.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Or consider Asian design. &ldquo;Far Eastern architecture uses timber structures, which in many cases are put together without any joints or fixings at all,&rdquo; Collard says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a culture where buildings are designed to be taken down and rebuilt&mdash;looking exactly the same but with slightly newer materials.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Implementing circular-economy principles requires a forward-looking approach to building that references those ancient examples. &ldquo;We need to design and build with the idea that buildings will not be demolished at the end of their life, but rather will be taken apart carefully,&rdquo; says Collard, adding that architects and engineers can use tools such as Revit to document materials and methods to make it easier for successors to reuse them. &ldquo;That will require a rather significant shift in mindset to consider the longevity of materials and who might want to use them next.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Environmental regulators can help by creating laws and policies to manage the carbon that buildings emit through their use of energy and the carbon that&rsquo;s embodied in their materiality.<\/p>\n\n<p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/787521383?h=5f41aa4a46\" width=\"640\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We still have the major problem that adaptation and reuse is generally more expensive than building the same footprint from new&mdash;so unless a price is put on embodied carbon, effectively penalizing demolition, the impact on cost has to be sold to the client,&rdquo; Ricard says. &ldquo;Why build to a 30-year design life if we can build to 60 or 90 with a 30-year interim upgrade? This is the approach being adopted by many of our corporate clients in the assessment of their estate.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, technology gives architects increased knowledge, accuracy, and collaboration, bridging the gap between the wasteful building of yesteryear and the more efficient building of tomorrow.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Particularly with reuse projects, where you&rsquo;re inheriting a building or materials from someone else, you need to know what you&rsquo;re working with, and you need to be able to share that information with all the other people who are working on your project,&rdquo; Collard says. &ldquo;Technology is an integral part of that. It translates the old into the new.&rdquo;<\/p>\n"},

The problem is that this traditional linear economy model offers a one-way route to economic inefficiency and ecological failure. In contrast, the circular economy&mdash;a holistic approach to human endeavors, actions, and experiences focused on sustainability&mdash;seeks to engineer, redefine, and monetize &ldquo;waste&rdquo; not as refuse, but as resources.<\/p>\n\n<p>The circular economy seeks to keep materials, products, and services in circulation as long as possible, seeing waste as the start of a profitable journey, not as an offramp from the highway of economic productivity. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/recyclingstrategy\/what-circular-economy\" target=\"_blank\">According to the EPA<\/a>, this means that from a product&rsquo;s outset, circular economic strategy retains materials in the value chain as long as possible, rethinking material extraction and manufacturing, transportation, and packaging, and even abolishing the idea of &ldquo;convenient,&rdquo; single-use anything.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fifty-three years after the recycling symbol was introduced on the first Earth Day, it&rsquo;s clear the current system of resource management has fallen short. According to the United Nations, continuing on this current destructive course means reaching 190 billion tons of material extraction by 2060, well beyond what the planet can support.<\/p>\n\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"509\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Lc-FQvPO89Y\" title=\"Butterfly diagram animation\" width=\"905\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Butterfly diagram animation, copyright Ellen MacArthur Foundation.<\/figcaption>\n\n<h2><strong>Principles of Circular Economy<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>The circular economy is a systems solution framework for tackling some of today&rsquo;s most pressing challenges, including a looming resource shortage, environmental degradation, climate change, and economic and social justice. At its simplest, it&#39;s centered on four elements: reduce, reuse, recycle, and recover. Economies, which range in scale from a household to a company to an <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/circular-city\">entire city<\/a> or country, need to be reconfigured around eliminating waste and pollution wherever possible; designing out waste; circulating products and materials at their highest value for the longest period of time possible; and investing in processes that regenerate nature&mdash;especially in agriculture and material extraction.<\/p>\n\n<p>The concept of circularity grew out of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/agenda\/2021\/01\/what-systems-thinking-actually-means-and-why-it-matters-today\/\" target=\"_blank\">systems thinking<\/a>, social justice constructs, and the burgeoning environmental movement of the 1960s. A number of thinkers and economists contributed to the concept&rsquo;s emergence, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.resources.org\/archives\/economic-principles-for-spaceship-earth\/\" target=\"_blank\">Kenneth Boulding<\/a>, an American economist, educator, peace activist, and interdisciplinary philosopher, who wrote of a &ldquo;cyclical&rdquo; system of production in 1966. The term &ldquo;circular economy&rdquo; first appeared in 1988 in environmental economist <a href=\"https:\/\/www.resources.org\/archives\/in-appreciation-dr-allen-v-kneese\/\">Allen Kneese<\/a>&rsquo;s article &ldquo;The Economics of Natural Resources.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"man walking across smart bridge\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2UyYTkyZDJmMTYzLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTU3OTliYTRkNWY1MzlhNjE4NTY0MmZmZjViOWYyMDk5\" style=\"height:467px; width:700px\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Dar and Autodesk Research smart bridge at Autodesk University 2022 was produced using generative design, additive manufacturing and other technologies that can make manufacturing and construction more efficient and reduce material use and environmental impact.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Benefits of Circular Economy<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>The circular economy concept might seem like a lofty, radical shift. But initial research and small-scale examples show the benefits of this systems-focused philosophy.<\/p>\n\n<p><iframe border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"103\" scroll=\"none\" src=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/hubsFront\/embed_cta\/486525\" width=\"250\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n<h3>Restoring Wildlife and Native Habitats<\/h3>\n\n<p>The circular approach focuses on sustainable materials selection, extraction, and design, offering substantial benefits to the environment, especially the scourge of plastics pollution. The EPA estimates greenhouse gas emissions from plastics alone are predicted to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/system\/files\/documents\/2022-09\/EPA_Circular_Economy_Progress_Report_Sept_2022.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">nearly double<\/a> by 2060, based on current rates of growth. More than 14 million tons of plastic end up in the oceans every year, harming marine life and clogging fragile coastal ecosystems.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regenerative ocean farming can help by boosting marine ecosystems and biodiversity. <a href=\"https:\/\/ellenmacarthurfoundation.org\/circular-examples\/regenerative-ocean-farming\" target=\"_blank\">GreenWave&rsquo;s<\/a>&nbsp;3D ocean farming method mimics the vertical structure of an ocean reef, providing layers of different habitats for diverse marine species, including shellfish and seaweeds. This approach can be used for regenerative farming of products used for food, fertilizer, animal feed, and bioplastics.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Increasing Revenue, Resilience, and Economic Activity for Businesses and Nations<\/h3>\n\n<p>Reusing materials and natural resources provides more than an environmental boost: Extensive economic research shows it can help a company&rsquo;s, and country&rsquo;s, bottom line. A study by Sitra found that Finland&rsquo;s circular economy plan is projected to boost the nation&rsquo;s economic impact by 3 billion euros by 2030. While the International Labor Organization predicts that circular economic practices will cost the world 71 million jobs by 2030, it also will make up for it by creating 78 million jobs over the same time period.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"digital twin of buildings\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2UyYTk5NDkyZjBlLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWM1MDQ4MTdlZjYxZmNhZjkwZTUxNmViOWI4YjlmYmI1\" style=\"height:426px; width:700px\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Using digital twins of buildings and products before production can cut down on unnecessary waste.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h3>Cutting Material Costs<\/h3>\n\n<p>Reusing existing products can offer significant cost savings across industries. Research from architectural firm Gensler found that clients could save <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gensler.com\/blog\/circular-economy-reusing-materials-to-save-cost-lower-carbon\" target=\"_blank\">30&ndash;50%<\/a> on renovation projects by being more judicious about repurposing existing materials. A Goldman Sachs analysis of circular economy benefits estimated roughly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goldmansachs.com\/insights\/pages\/companies-should-think-circular-to-cut-waste-costs-and-emissions.html\" target=\"_blank\">$1 trillion<\/a> in annual material costs could be saved by a wholesale change.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Helping Avert the Climate Crisis<\/h3>\n\n<p>The circular model can make a significant impact on sectors of the economy responsible for excessive emissions, including transportation and construction. The focus on regenerative agriculture and protecting habitat and biodiversity can also help make the landscape more resilient and able to withstand rising temperatures and changing weather patterns.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Improving Social and Economic Justice<\/h3>\n\n<p>Much of the traditional, linear model of manufacturing relies on low material costs, lax environmental regulations, low wages, and nonexistent worker protections. Creating more sustainable models of production eliminated race-to-the-bottom manufacturing practices that often leave the poorest workers saddled with low wages and the impacts of toxic pollution.

Making smaller, incremental changes in operations can help pave the way toward a wholesale change.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the most important transformations is designing for less waste. An <a href=\"http:\/\/naviradjou.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Frugal-Innovation_Intro-Chapter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">oft-cited statistic<\/a> postulates that 70% of a product&rsquo;s lifecycle costs are determined at the design stage. Using <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/what-is-generative-design\">generative design<\/a> technologies and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/solutions\/additive-manufacturing\">additive manufacturing<\/a> reduces mass and excess material, which also reduces cost and environmental impact. Companies can also swap out existing materials for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engineering.com\/story\/embracing-circularity-in-manufacturing-with-carbon-fiber-recycling\" target=\"_blank\">low-carbon options<\/a>, design products for longer lifecycles, or redesign the product experience so items are rented or leased instead of purchased and thrown away.<\/p>\n\n<p>Better data management and material control can also cut down on unnecessary waste. A key example is using <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/what-is-a-digital-twin\">digital twins<\/a> in construction, which helps stakeholders assess materials and labor costs accurately. Firms can focus on sustainable supply chain management, which addresses everything from sourcing goods to how they&rsquo;re stored and shipped; emissions from the supply chain are typically <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdp.net\/en\/research\/global-reports\/transparency-to-transformation\" target=\"_blank\">over 11 times higher<\/a> than operational emissions.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"mineral wool waste\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2UyYWEwZDMwMGIyLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWNkNTdhMTU2MjI0NDFlM2UzMDFiZWE4YjViNDAyZDMy\" style=\"height:438px; width:700px\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Finnish company EcoUp has patented its method for making mineral wool waste into a new raw material. Courtesy of EcoUp Corporation.<\/figcaption>\n\n<figure>\n<h2><strong>Barriers to Circularity<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Often, the barriers to adopting circular principles lay in cultural norms and a lack of supportive governmental policies.<\/p>\n\n<p>First, there&rsquo;s a general lack of awareness and of mainstream success stories to help sell the circular economy concept and overcome reluctance to change cultural and social norms. There&rsquo;s also widespread fear about the repercussions of making consumer products less convenient. Changing a company&rsquo;s packaging, usage models, and even ownership models can be overcome, but requires intentional shifts, user research, and market research.<\/p>\n\n<p>Better widespread understanding of something seemingly as established as recycling can help overcome misunderstandings about the value of making changes. More standardization of the concept would help accelerate that mindset shift, clarifying for companies and consumers what circular means and how to make larger shifts toward recycling and reusing materials across different industries.<\/p>\n\n<p>This lack of awareness can feed into other, more systemic problems. Often, localities lack the right infrastructure to enable companies to make these changes, including enough waste treatment centers and up-to-date recycling technology. And the costs of using virgin materials are often much lower, especially at the outset, than scaling up regenerative processes. Firms understand that making circularity economically feasible often means significant upfront costs in research and infrastructure, which can be barriers to change.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"man walking through affordable housing complex\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2UyYWEzODZiZTU0LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWRiYTE2NzYzY2YxMTZmZjA4OGRhZTkyNmRiZjc2ZjMy\" style=\"height:496px; width:700px\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">White Arkitekter focuses on sustainable building design and won a Danish social housing competition for this affordable housing complex.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Examples of a Circular Economy<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>One way of explaining the circular economy, <a href=\"https:\/\/ellenmacarthurfoundation.org\/circular-economy-diagram\" target=\"_blank\">the butterfly diagram<\/a>, shows the many paths that can lead to a systemic shift, including different waste streams and means of reusing materials. There&rsquo;s significant diversity in the types of firms that have successfully embraced a circular philosophy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Global carpet brand <a href=\"https:\/\/professionals.tarkett.com\/en_EU\/node\/desso-carpet-tile-and-roll-solutions-innovation-functionality-and-sustainability-5527\" target=\"_blank\">Desso<\/a> (manufactured by Tarkett) instituted a &ldquo;cradle-to-cradle&rdquo; program, making its products with reusable yarn and starting a buy-back program, guaranteeing that material didn&rsquo;t get tossed but instead was fed back into the production process. Finnish firm <a href=\"https:\/\/ecoup.fi\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\">EcoUp<\/a> makes carbon-neutral thermal insulation in part by sourcing its materials from construction waste. Levi&rsquo;s Jeans <a href=\"https:\/\/www.levi.com\/US\/en_US\/blog\/article\/repair-reimagine-recycle\" target=\"_blank\">recycles and repairs<\/a> its iconic dungarees, while Patagonia&rsquo;s pledge to repair clothing for life builds brand loyalty while curtailing fabric waste. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.interface.com\/US\/en-US\/sustainability\/carbon-negative.html\" target=\"_blank\">Interface<\/a>, a certified carbon-neutral business, makes carbon-negative carpet tiles by storing more carbon through recycled and bio-based materials than they emit.<\/p>\n\n<p>Canadian firm <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/sustainable-construction\">BamCore<\/a> has industrialized and sped up commercial and residential construction using custom fabrication, 3D animated models, and industrialized construction. But its core innovation is using sustainably harvested bamboo as the key element of its hollow-wall structural lumber system. The combination of data-driven digital construction and sustainable materials means more projects can be finished faster, with much less material waste. The prefabrication system even uses augmented reality models on jobsites, so construction workers can visualize the finished project as they assemble it.<\/p>\n\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"509\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/keDa-zQihsk\" title=\"Selma Lagerl\u00f6fs Center, Gothenburg\" width=\"905\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n<p>Another construction firm, Sweden&rsquo;s <a href=\"https:\/\/redshift.autodesk.com\/articles\/recycling-building-materials\">White Arkitekter<\/a>, has differentiated itself with a focus on sustainability and recycling.

This is also the spot from which the distance separating Paris from other cities is calculated.<\/p>\n\n<p>The &Icirc;le de la Cit&eacute; has witnessed more than 800 years of urban transformation, making the challenge of redeveloping these 10 acres on the Seine a unique opportunity to reinvent and shape a peaceful, inclusive, and sustainable city that is concerned about its environment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"daytime view of Notre-Dame and the surrounding water\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2YxNzZmZmYyNWVlLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTAxODNjZTNmYWEzMmMxNDUzZTQ4Yjc0NzAwNjlmZjE4\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Transforming the parking garage under the forecourt will make the new public space greener, more open, and larger than before.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<h2><strong>A Symbolic Transformation<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>The first major ecological act proposed by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bassmets.be\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bureau Bas Smets<\/a>&nbsp;team is a plan to decarbonize the area.

It has created a metal-additive printing system called BOLDseries that is affordable, portable, and easy to use, without compromising on part quality.

But nylons, polycarbonates, and styrenes turn out a porous material that has a relatively weak underlying chemical foundation. Printing with metal is a different game: Heavy industrial products like turbine blades and vehicle engines need stronger stuff. Only metal has the potential to provide a firm crystalline microstructure that can withstand industrial-scale stress, heat, and pressure.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>One Click Metal&rsquo;s vending machine&ndash;size units use an industrial-grade metal powder that&rsquo;s safely packaged into standardized cartridges. Plug one in, load or tweak a 3D design file created using a tool such as Autodesk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/netfabb\/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription\">Netfabb<\/a>, and click &ldquo;print.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The MPRINT 3D-printing unit&rsquo;s 200-watt fiber laser allows great productivity and precision with complex metal applications. Combining two functions into one machine, the MPUREpro machine unpacks a component and removes any unused powder with direct powder contact, and its integrated, autonomous ultrasonic sieve&nbsp;recycles processed powder into a supply cartridge, which can then be used again. The MPRINT units are also versatile enough to create their own parts. Using Autodesk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/fusion-360\/overview\">Fusion 360<\/a>, One Click Metal was able to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/customer-stories\/one-click-metal-fusion-360\">design and output<\/a> the sophisticated driver component that opens and closes the powder cartridges.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"person using the MPRINT metal additive manufacturing machine\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2ZkNWU1OGIzMTYzLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWNmNzdlMTZkYzBhODZiOGRhMTA3MGZiMWE5YjI3MWU1\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">One Click Metal designed the MPRINT for optimal ease of use to allow more small and midsize manufacturers entry into the growing metal 3D-printing market. Courtesy of One Click Metal.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Due to the limited space in the assembly area and the specifications of the motor manufacturer, only a feather key can be used for power transmission,&rdquo; says One Click Metal CEO Gerrit Brueggemann. &ldquo;Either the keyway must be created by pushing or broaching, or the feather key has to be milled into the component. The additive design and process is the better solution here.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Instead of making drivers individually, One Click Metal used Netfabb to stack the parts. When designing the part, care was taken to ensure the parts could be stacked without being too difficult to support. For that reason, the parts are always stacked on top of each other rotated by 180 degrees, resulting in surfaces that are easily supported. &ldquo;That really reduces the time and cost of production,&rdquo; Brueggemann says.<\/p>\n\n<h2>A Growing Market<\/h2>\n\n<p>One Click Metal&rsquo;s entry into the metal additive printing market may be perfectly timed. Grand View Research valued the global metal-3D-printing market at $3.52 billion last year, with annual growth projections of 23.9% expected between 2022 and 2030. According to the firm&rsquo;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grandviewresearch.com\/industry-analysis\/metal-3d-printing-market\" target=\"_blank\">recent report<\/a>, &ldquo;Metal 3D printing has benefitted significantly from the growing necessity of rapid prototyping and advanced manufacturing practices.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>NASA has also jumped on board. The US space agency says it intends to 3D print <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/centers\/marshall\/news\/releases\/2020\/future-rocket-engines-may-include-large-scale-3d-printing.html\" target=\"_blank\">more than 80%<\/a> of its future rocket engines using metal additive systems. Elon Musk&rsquo;s SpaceX has also announced investments in 3D metal printing to augment the company&rsquo;s manufacturing capabilities.<\/p>\n\n<p>Construction could be the next frontier. In 2021, Imperial College London installed and opened the world&rsquo;s first 3D-printed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/newsround\/57864409\" target=\"_blank\">metallic bridge<\/a> in Amsterdam.<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"person using the MPRINT machine\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2ZkNWVkZjQ2OTkxLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTZmMjgyYmNkMDY3OWQ0ZWZhZGZmYTkwYWMyZTBlODkx\" style=\"float:right; margin:20px 25px\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">MPRINT uses a laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process for metal additive, with a 150 mm by 150 mm by 150 mm build volume.

One Click Metal&rsquo;s business model depends on bringing the power of 3D metal to the SME market, making what has been an out-of-reach purchase cheaper and easier to deploy in smaller settings.<\/p>\n\n<p>Space, expense, complexity, and safety have been major hurdles for metal 3D printing. One Click Metal has jumped them using cloud-based collaboration tools that brought the parent company&rsquo;s laser experts and supply chain partners together to problem-solve and provide complementary design input.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We identified three key barriers to taking metal additive printing to a wider market,&rdquo;&nbsp; Brueggemann says. &ldquo;The first was the metal powder itself. The handling process is a big issue, especially for small companies that use the machine right next to their conventional manufacturing machines. For quality purposes, the powder can&rsquo;t be allowed to get wet or contaminated.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>The second challenge was how to design a 3D metal printing machine for both functionality and affordability. The third was making a machine that wouldn&rsquo;t require extensive training. &ldquo;We knew it had to be easy to use,&rdquo; Brueggemann says. &ldquo;Many companies wouldn&rsquo;t be using it 24\/7 from the beginning&mdash;they start with first ideas like prototypes that result in products over the long term. At the industry level, the initial investment costs have been a major reason for or against the cost of 3D metal printing.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"MPRINT machine cartridge revolver\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTEyODE5MCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2ZkNWY4NDNiMjI0LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTQ4ZWQyYWM2YWI4N2VkMzg1ZTVmNWZlMjhhY2E2OWE4\" \/>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">MPRINT&rsquo;s five-cartridge revolver holds a powder supply 250% of the build volume when filled to capacity. Courtesy of One Click Metal.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n<p>To that end, one of One Click Metal&rsquo;s key innovations has been a standardized cartridge for metal powder. This eliminates the need for open powder handling, ensures quality, and enables reclamation for reusing powder.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The whole process is similar for all LPBF machines on the market, but we knew it is not enough just to have a good machine,&rdquo; Brueggemann says. &ldquo;The whole process is still new, so we brought it all together with a vision of the one-click method the customer wants.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Flying Into the Future<\/h2>\n\n<p>The machines are currently optimized for outputs in the 150 cm&ndash;by&ndash;150 cm range, which leaves a lot of room for innovation. One Click Metal has used its MPRINT machine to create a working drone that integrates multiple flight components into a single, highly complex metal form.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;One of our employees is a drone pilot, and he had the idea of using the machine to create an optimized metal drone,&rdquo; Brueggemann says, noting that the company then contacted Autodesk&rsquo;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/solutions\/generative-design\">generative design<\/a> team for advice on how to do it. &ldquo;We looked at all the individual parts of a drone and tried different designs that could incorporate them into a single frame. Fusion 360 was great at pointing us toward approaches that optimized and also helped control costs.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<embed><\/embed>\n\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/QRvT3x5ys-Y\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n<h2>Collaborating in the Cloud<\/h2>\n\n<p>As the company prepares for another busy year of global trade events and sales engagements, Brueggemann says collaboration is going to be key to One Click Metal&rsquo;s growth.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;In the sales process, we and our sales partners help customers find the right solution for their problem, providing cost calculations and additive design advice,&rdquo; Brueggemann says. &ldquo;Fusion 360 and Netfabb are ideal for that. They have the best features and the best price. Also&mdash;it keeps getting better and better.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>He adds that Autodesk&rsquo;s programs for educational institutions provide another source of value. &ldquo;We are working with universities and students on various projects,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;This way everyone can work as a team in the cloud using the same design platform.&rdquo;<\/p>"},
