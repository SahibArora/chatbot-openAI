Schultz and Cogan have extensive leadership experience and proven success in strengthening organizations. Together they are bringing a refreshed strategic vision to Uberflip&rsquo;s next chapter with plans to steer the company toward continued success and growth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Bringing in a new CEO and CRO will grow Uberflip in new ways,&rdquo; said Simon Wilson, Executive Chair at Uberflip. &ldquo;Their collective experience will allow us to not only continue to deliver exceptional value to our clients, but will further solidify Uberflip&rsquo;s position as the leader in content experience.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Schultz brings more than 25 years of sales strategy and executive experience to Uberflip. Most recently, he was the CEO of Modus, a B2B SaaS company specializing in marketing software, where he steered the company to a 30%+ year-over-year SaaS growth and a 94%+ retention rate. His strategic leadership led to a successful exit through an acquisition in July 2023.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;As I take on responsibility as CEO, my focus is leading with integrity, empowering our team, and charting a course for sustained excellence,&rdquo; said Schultz. &ldquo;With Uberflip being the pioneer of content experiences, we are able to position ourselves in a place where we can continue to thrive and evolve as fast as our clients&rsquo; needs.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Schultz started his career in advertising sales and held roles including Vice President of Commercial sales at Salesforce, EVP Strategy &amp; Revenue at SAVO Group, and Head of Sales Operations and Enablement at DexYP. Schultz is the Chairperson of the Board at Concerts for Cancer Foundation, a nonprofit organization he co-founded in 2019. Through this foundation, he contributes to raising funds for &quot;make-a-wish&quot; style grants, providing support to cancer fighters and their caregivers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Cogan brings more than 20 years experience supporting, designing and executing revenue generating models. His experience spans sales, customer success, partnerships, strategy and operations. He was GM of the Americas at Piano, a Digital Experience Platform. Prior to Piano, Cogan was SVP of Sales at Lytics, a customer data platform. At Jama Software, Cogan led Sales and CS and helped drive a $200 million growth equity investment from Insight Partners.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;As CRO, I plan to do more than just drive revenue growth, but also create strategic partnerships, and optimize our sales and marketing efforts,&rdquo; said Cogan. &ldquo;This will be a seamless transition for our clients who will continue to receive unparalleled innovation. It&rsquo;s an honor to join the Uberflip team and work closely alongside Jeremy to leverage our collective strengths and navigate this economy and industry together.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Uberflip<\/strong><br \/>\nUberflip is a content engagement platform that empowers marketing and sales to create engaging, relevant content destinations quickly for every campaign, audience, and stage of the customer journey.

Ashley noted that while working as a consultant, she noticed that almost every marketing organization faced the same common pain points. Throughout her career, she&rsquo;s recognized the need to stay focused on three core issues: engaging with customers, supporting sales organizations, and building a strong organization with the ability to scale and grow over time.<\/li>\n\t<li data-test-bidi=\"\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(29, 29, 31); font-family: &quot;SF Pro Text&quot;, &quot;SF Pro Icons&quot;, &quot;Apple WebExp Icons Custom&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; letter-spacing: -0.065px; orphans: 2; widows: 2; text-decoration-thickness: initial;\">Hold one another accountable. When working in a team setting, holding one another accountable to your overarching goals is essential. Ashley mentioned that with every new campaign or program they launch, she and her team always ensure that they are keeping the customer&rsquo;s voice top of mind, and holding each other accountable to this mission is critical.<\/li>\n\t<li data-test-bidi=\"\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(29, 29, 31); font-family: &quot;SF Pro Text&quot;, &quot;SF Pro Icons&quot;, &quot;Apple WebExp Icons Custom&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; letter-spacing: -0.065px; orphans: 2; widows: 2; text-decoration-thickness: initial;\">The customer experience has changed. In recent years, customers have become more savvy and educated than they ever have been before in history. This has presented a new challenge for marketers and an opportunity to lean into the organic side of creating the customer experience through excellent content. As Ashley mentioned, not everyone has cracked the code just yet, but things are moving in the right direction.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p data-test-bidi=\"\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(29, 29, 31); font-family: &quot;SF Pro Text&quot;, &quot;SF Pro Icons&quot;, &quot;Apple WebExp Icons Custom&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; letter-spacing: -0.065px; orphans: 2; widows: 2; text-decoration-thickness: initial;\">Learn more about Ramp here: <a href=\"https:\/\/ramp.com\/\">https:\/\/ramp.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p data-test-bidi=\"\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(29, 29, 31); font-family: &quot;SF Pro Text&quot;, &quot;SF Pro Icons&quot;, &quot;Apple WebExp Icons Custom&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; letter-spacing: -0.065px; orphans: 2; widows: 2; text-decoration-thickness: initial;\">Learn more about Ashley here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ashleybrucker\/\">https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ashleybrucker\/<\/a><\/p>\n"}

More content doesn&rsquo;t equal better engagement. Instead, focus on making sure the content you create is getting used and, more importantly, being seen by your prospects.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>You likely found this article because you&#39;re having trouble getting your content noticed. Well, just like you, your customers are looking for answers to their problems. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re in the right place&mdash;we&#39;ll share secrets about how we got you here!<\/p>\n\n<p>While creating ad hoc pieces to generate traffic might get you a lot of views, there&rsquo;s no guarantee you&rsquo;ll reach the prospects who will convert. When <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/ebook\/the-experience-disconnect\" target=\"_blank\">we surveyed 250 B2B buyers<\/a> about their experiences, they said that content personalized to their problems and content they might be interested in create a great experience. Knowing your audience allows you to create relevant and captivating content. But once you&rsquo;ve created this perfect material, how can you ensure your buyers are finding it?<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve curated the ultimate, binge-worthy content journey for your customers, implement these seven distribution tactics to increase your content&#39;s reach:<\/p>\n\n<h2>1. Optimize content for organic search<\/h2>\n\n<p>When writing your top- and middle-of-funnel content, your goal is to cast a wide net to get on your prospects&rsquo; radar and identify those interested. A strong organic SEO strategy can help you be a part of the right conversations as prospects search for answers to their problems. So, how do you implement this strong organic <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/seo\" target=\"_blank\">SEO<\/a> strategy? Ensure you&rsquo;ve created a relevant keyword list, then mindfully include those keywords in your page titles and URLs. Adding alt image tags, implementing an SEO title, and writing a compelling meta description as a preview for your content can all help to fully capitalize on organic search. Ticking these items off the list will help you to optimize your content and rise through search engine ranks.<\/p>\n\n<h2>2. Power your social media strategy<\/h2>\n\n<p>Sharing your high-value content on social media is a great way to drive top-of-funnel traffic to your content hub or website. But there should be more to your distribution plan than just posting a link on your social channels. Move beyond the spray-and-pray approach and lean into providing value for your audience on social media.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have a brand new <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/ebook\/2022-sales-content-engagement-report\" target=\"_blank\">Sales Engagement Report<\/a> that you want to share with your audience. Your LinkedIn audience may be most interested in the key insights and prove willing to click through to the full report whereas your Instagram audience might be more interested in bite-sized statistics that they can consume on the go. In fact, you might decide Instagram isn&#39;t the right fit at all as your audience might not be looking to click through and read any sort of report. When you&#39;re planning your B2B content distribution plan, think about how your content might resonate differently on each platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>3. Nurture prospects in email<\/h2>\n\n<p>Your email subscribers are a base of contacts who have expressed interest in keeping up with you. They want to know more about your brand and see you as a credible voice for information on the topics they&rsquo;re interested in, so handle them with care! Use your high-value content to <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/uberflip-blog-posts\/effective-b2b-email-subject-lines\" target=\"_blank\">nurture and engage your contacts<\/a>&mdash;this is where the strategy comes into play&mdash;without inundating their inbox.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>You might be reading this with a frown, given the cluttered nature of the average email inbox. But email is a vital part of the prospect nurture journey. When you distribute the right content to a well-targeted audience, you create an exclusive touchpoint that feels personal to your subscribers. You&rsquo;ll boost your <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/uberflip-blog-posts\/email-marketing-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\">open rates<\/a> and engagement with your content!<\/p>\n\n<h2>4. Empower your sales teams<\/h2>\n\n<p>Marketing and sales alignment only improves your buyer experience. A well-oiled <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/uberflip-blog-posts\/smarketing-keeping-it-real-between-sales-and-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">smarketing<\/a> machine encourages insight and knowledge sharing, achieving a smoother and more successful customer hand-off from marketing to sales. Marketing can also leverage sales insights to create higher-value content to arm their sales team.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your sales teams have built relationships with prospects and buyers, they know what content will engage them best. So it only makes sense to leverage your sales team when you&#39;re trying to distribute your content&mdash;especially as it could be content you worked with sales to create.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>When you create a new piece of content you know your sales team will love, ensure they can easily find it. Tools such as <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/blog\/how-to-empower-your-sales-team-with-sales-assist\" target=\"_blank\">Sales Assist<\/a> make this quick and easy. Your sales team can search via tags to find and pull content into an email or create a stream. No matter where they engage with prospects, they can share content from within the applications they use every day, such as Salesloft, Outreach, Gmail, and more. Your sales team is vital to getting your content in front of your target audience.<\/p>\n\n<h2>5. Build awareness through a link exchange&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Link exchanges not only help drive traffic to your hub but are also beneficial to your SEO. Having links on sites outside your own tells search engines that your content is trustworthy and helps to give more credibility to your content.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are a couple of ways to do this:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Implement it as part of your PR strategy<\/strong> and submit content to external publications or blogs outside your own channels with links back to your hub and content.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Enter into link swap agreements<\/strong> with business friends. This would involve you providing an article for them to host on their website in exchange for you hosting one of theirs on your hub or website&mdash;both would contain links back to their own assets. Link swapping with a business with a high page ranking can also help improve your SEO ranking.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>6. Tap into brand ambassadors&rsquo; networks<\/h2>\n\n<p>Getting your customers and subscribers to advocate for you is a great way to increase your reach and be introduced to other networks by someone with clout and credibility. Brand ambassadors are people who have experience with your brand or product and are happy to share their positive experiences or support your brand with their network. <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/customer-engagement\" target=\"_blank\">A well-defined customer marketing strategy<\/a> may include fostering brand ambassadors. No matter how large or small their following, or the frequency of their activity, leveraging their audience adds up to a bigger audience for your content.<\/p>\n\n<p>To regularly engage your advocate community, you can also explore offering rewards or other incentives.<\/p>\n\n<h2>7. Leverage high-value content in digital ads<\/h2>\n\n<p>A great way to target audiences based on specific characteristics is through paid distribution on social media, search, and display ad placements. But as you&#39;re investing more than time here, you should have a clear strategy in place.<\/p>\n\n<p>Use your premium gated assets and events to drive lead generation. Use your top-of-funnel content to drive traffic to your hub and increase discoverability. Just make sure you choose assets that complement your campaign objectives at the appropriate stage in the buyer journey. Try investing in your premium content (ebooks, webinars, white papers, etc.), so you can strategically gate it for a higher lead generation rate. And ensure the content on the other side of the gate is worthwhile!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Content amplification isn&rsquo;t about volume<\/h2>\n\n<p>There are endless opportunities to distribute your content, and while you want as many prospects and buyers as possible to see it, don&rsquo;t fall into the volume trap. An audience that&#39;s a million strong is no good if it&#39;s not your target audience. Your goal should be to create content with purpose and define your distribution strategy before you start creating it. Answering simple questions like &quot;who&#39;s it for?&quot; and &quot;why do they need it?&quot; will help you create a better content experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to leverage these distribution tactics to create a compelling journey. Distribution is one part, but the focus should be holistic, centered on distributing to the right people at the right time, with the right level of personalization. When <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/ebook\/the-experience-disconnect\" target=\"_blank\">we surveyed 250 marketers<\/a> we found that they prioritize creating social media, email, and video content, in that order. Conversely, social media didn&rsquo;t even make it into the top three for the 250 B2B buyers we surveyed. If marketers are not meeting the buyer where they are, with the content they want to consume, they might completely miss out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>No matter how your prospects find you, make sure there will always be somewhere else for them to go next. Not sure how to perfect that next step? Don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got you covered with our <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/uberflip-blog-posts\/10-call-to-action-examples-youll-want-to-steal\" target=\"_blank\">CTA best practices<\/a>.<\/p>\n"}

With access to more data than ever before, you can ensure the content experience you&rsquo;re giving your customers is what they need.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before we dive in to talk about how Uberflip Analytics provides you with the data you need to face real-world problems in your day-to-day role, let&rsquo;s get you up to speed with two helpful definitions:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>1. <strong>Streams<\/strong> are content destinations that curate content from your library to create a personalized experience for the audience.<br \/>\n2. The <strong>Content Hub<\/strong> is the back end of the Uberflip platform, which hosts your collection of Marketing Streams. All of your content assets and Streams live within a content hub.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, let&rsquo;s get started! Here are just some of the ways Uberflip Analytics can answer the content experience questions that are on your mind.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f37869ed-7fff-503a-5ad9-68a914632141\">1. <\/span>How can I accelerate the buyer journey?<\/h2>\n\n<p>According to Forrester, buyers on average consume <a href=\"https:\/\/www.focusvision.com\/resources\/content-really-is-king-content-consumption-in-the-b2b-buyers-journey\/\" target=\"_blank\">13 pieces of content<\/a> before making a purchase decision, but it&rsquo;s our job as marketers to get them to that point as fast as possible. What&rsquo;s the best way to achieve this? Encourage buyers to binge on your content.<\/p>\n\n<p>Uberflip Analytics helps you understand the performance of content destinations in terms of engagement, content consumption, and conversion. You&rsquo;re probably used to seeing pages per session as a metric in platforms like Google Analytics, but we take it one step further by showing you <strong>items<\/strong> per session. This is a more accurate indicator of engagement because it ties back to actual content consumed.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Uberflip Analytics chart that shows stream performance\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV81ZTg3NTJhNzVjYjhmLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTJmZTg4NjQ5ZDg4ODc1MTk1NzI0M2E4ZDUzNDVhNGUx\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>It can also show you the breakdown between:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>New and returning visitors<\/li>\n\t<li>Your destination&rsquo;s bounce rate<\/li>\n\t<li>Whether it led to a conversion activity<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>You can drill down into a specific content destination or stream to see:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>What items are the most popular<\/li>\n\t<li>Visitor trends over time<\/li>\n\t<li>Individual session details<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>So why are having these insights important? You can ensure your hub and streams are optimized to achieve your goals and provide the best recommendations to your buyers. Understanding and optimizing your stream performance accelerates your buyer journey, getting them to the purchase stage faster.&nbsp;Uberflip&#39;s embedded dashboards make optimizing even more straightforward. <a href=\"https:\/\/help.uberflip.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/5665837787533\" target=\"_blank\">Embedded dashboards<\/a> make it easy to leverage performance data while making changes in streams. You can streamline your content experience decision-making with valuable summary metrics embedded directly in the stream and item management workflow. Sales reps can also view account and contact summary dashboards within CRM accounts and contact pages, allowing them to better understand how content can help support their selling activity.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"Embedded item performance\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82Mjg0ZWI4MDdkMzlkLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTc0YzZkNjQ3MDY1OTlkYmYyNjE1YTIwMWQ0YWMwNjFl\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f37869ed-7fff-503a-5ad9-68a914632141\">2. <\/span>How can I optimize my CTA conversions?<\/h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When it comes to Uberflip calls-to-action (CTAs), they&rsquo;re more than your standard offerings. Uberflip has the option for CTAs to be an item on your stream, gate content, or content recommended to engage the buyer.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Uberflip Analytics provides three important metrics to look at CTA performance: impressions (how many times your CTA appears), activations (the number of times a visitor clicked into your CTA), and submissions (the number of times a visitor successfully submitted your CTA).&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzQ5ZTViMDE4Yjk5LnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWYxMGM2OGRlZDc0ZDBhNTUwNmIzZDcyOGY1NGRjNDc5\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These three metrics allow you to get a detailed understanding of how your CTAs are performing. For example, a high number of impressions and activations but low submissions, means something is causing visitors to stop. Alternatively, a low number of impressions may be caused by the CTA placement or how many streams it&rsquo;s active on.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ultimately, you&rsquo;re aiming to increase submission rates to maximize both the quantity and quality of leads. By reviewing performance and optimizing the CTA placement in your stream, you can help your buyer move from one item to another in fewer sessions, taking them to the bottom of the funnel faster.<\/p>\n\n<h2>3. What content paths are my visitors taking?<\/h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We know the buyer journey isn&rsquo;t linear. It&rsquo;s a path filled with multiple entry and exit points. Understanding how your visitors move through your content is key to curating experiences that promote bingeing and engagement.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Uberflip Analytics tracks each visitor showing their path by stream, item, and the conversion rate associated with each of these paths. Insightful, right?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Understanding your stream performance allows you to see how buyers are moving through the content from one item to another, empowering you to create the most optimal path and better strategize how to put together high-performing content experiences.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f37869ed-7fff-503a-5ad9-68a914632141\">4. <\/span>What content is resonating best with my visitors?<\/h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Uberflip Analytics chart showing the themes that are resonating most with buyers\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MTlkMWQxMTcwMjdkLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPThjOGY5ZjIxZDllOWMwM2MzMGRkODQ3MmQ0OTY3MmQx\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>As a marketer, how do you know whether to focus on creating blogs, videos, whitepapers, or slide decks&hellip; or is there some other medium to concentrate on? To add to the complexity, it&rsquo;s often not that simple given that buyers, according to Forrester, need an average of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.focusvision.com\/resources\/content-really-is-king-content-consumption-in-the-b2b-buyers-journey\/\" target=\"_blank\">13 pieces of content<\/a> before making a purchasing decision (it&rsquo;s so important we&rsquo;re telling you again!). How do you find out what content is going to work best? You leverage the power of tags.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>By leveraging tags in Uberflip, you can:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Pull reports to uncover what topics and themes are resonating most with your buyers<\/li>\n\t<li>Measure content performance against different tag categories<\/li>\n\t<li>Discover where your content is lacking coverage and where you should invest in creating more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Using tags allows Uberflip Analytics to show content engagement by type, industry, and more (and with our augmented analytics feature, Enrichment, you can also see personas, specific buyers, and accounts straight from your marketing automation platform), helping you to better understand what works at different journey stages. By looking at content engagement based on tags, you can see more than just the amount of traffic specific content receives (vanity metric alert!) Instead, you can determine whether those visitors actually stuck around long enough to consume that piece of content, ultimately refining your content experience so your buyers can get to the content they want quicker.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>5. <\/span>What content is underperforming?<\/h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f37869ed-7fff-503a-5ad9-68a914632141\"><img alt=\"Uberflip Analytics report\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MzUyYzI0NzUzNTU5LnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWI0MTgwNTQwNmRmNmMzMDI3ZjgzNmEyOTk2ZWI3ZTQy\" style=\"margin-top:0px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>Forrester did a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forrester.com\/blogs\/crap-content-continues-to-describe-b2b-marketing-dont-let-it-describe-yours\/\" target=\"_blank\">study of B2B buyers<\/a> and found that 66% of them felt vendors gave them too much content, and 57% felt much of that content was useless&mdash;yikes!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Is the content your organization spends its time and resources creating getting used and driving engagement? If the answer is no, it&rsquo;s time to do something about it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Not to fear, Uberflip Analytics is here! Because our analytics are available at the item level, it&rsquo;s easy to see what content is getting zero engagement. That&rsquo;s a great starting point for your content team to assess which assets are not resonating, then dive in and find out why.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can also see content topics or formats that may not be working based on various patterns, helping you focus on creating the content that will drive leads and buyers deeper into the decision-making process. Maybe you&rsquo;ll decide to distribute the content in more places to see if that impacts performance, or choose to retire it if it&rsquo;s a little bit, well, you know... rubbish.<\/p>\n\n<p>The importance of a clean library can be underestimated, but underperforming content prevents your buyers from discovering content relevant to them and moving on down the funnel. It also hinders your team from locating the right content to share.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Bonus question: Can Uberflip give me the insights I need to optimize my customer experience?<\/h2>\n\n<p>In short, yes. I know what you&rsquo;re thinking: we&rsquo;re biased.

ContinuumCloud had to quickly switch their position and offering in these&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;unprecedented times.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>MaryJane Craig, Vice President of Marketing at ContinuumCloud, talked to Randy about how they ramped up a digital-first strategy to move from in-person events (which historically provided 80-90% of their pipeline) to a digitally driven demand generation strategy. Thankfully Uberflip and 6sense had the levers for ContinuumCloud to pull when they needed to grow, scale, and change fast to get to where they needed to be.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>As we dive into the details, ContinuumCloud demonstrates how ABM doesn&rsquo;t just have to be 1:1; it can be 1:few based on understanding the stage of the account. Content can be a solution for more than just the top funnel.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>How did they do it?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>To maximize their budget, ContinuumCloud targeted accounts with increasingly focused campaigns. The team couldn&rsquo;t create true 1:1 messaging for each of their accounts, but they wanted it to feel 1:1 to the buyers. That&rsquo;s where personalization at scale came in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>ContinuumCloud took cues from prospects to understand what and how much content the accounts were engaging with. Building off of that helped them to create a tailored experience in Uberflip. They used sales streams and dynamic tags and included logos to make their marketing efforts scalable without losing that personalization.<\/p>\n\n<p>ContinuumCloud wanted to recreate the handshake-at-a-conference experience to drive impact, so they leaned on Uberflip alongside their comprehensive tech stack to create an experience that made their customers feel like ContinuumCloud knew who they were.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What did the customer experience look like?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<h3>Identify&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n<p>ContinuumCloud has a well-defined market, so it made sense to take an account-based approach and get granular with their total addressable market. To help identify accounts that were actually in the market, they used 6sense; they also leveraged tools such as GuideStar and Candid for a broader view of account firmographic information and utilized Salesforce to expand within those accounts.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Attract<\/h3>\n\n<p>They kicked off with high-level awareness ads for those accounts at the top of the funnel and laid the groundwork for warm-up nurture through Pardot. Ads were served up through the 6sense network and Madison Logic content syndication. The CTAs routed to their Uberflip hub where they featured their most popular content to get accounts to start clicking around, creating Netflix-like consumption, and getting to know ContinuumCloud, leading them to activate an account.<\/p>\n\n<h3><img alt=\"The demand generation and ABM campaign that increased pipeline by 267%\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MWJiYTY4ZTNmZDdmLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTI5MGYyZjQ3OWZmYjc4M2ZjMjYzNzU2ZjkxMTg1ODRk\" \/><\/h3>\n\n<h3>Engage<\/h3>\n\n<p>With Uberflip being the endpoint, ContinuumCloud evolved the content being served up depending on the segment and audience. They created varied CTAs based on the top-level account segmentation model they used. The CTA served up would pull the different accounts into different layers of the funnel depending on their activity.<\/p>\n\n<p>By combining first-party data from Pardot and third-party data from 6sense, ContimuumCloud prioritized accounts and routed the relevant ones to deeper funnel content destinations vs. the top of funnel experience, such as the featured introductory experience seen in the screenshot above.<\/p>\n\n<h2>It&rsquo;s results time<\/h2>\n\n<p>ContinuumCloud has demonstrated how digital investment can be just as effective or, in this case, even more effective than a conference circuit.<\/p>\n\n<p>When comparing the second half of last year to the first half of this year, they saw:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A 267% increase in pipeline<\/li>\n\t<li>A 114.6% increase in sessions<\/li>\n\t<li>A 99% increase in site visitors<\/li>\n\t<li>A 57.1% increase in page views<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>What&rsquo;s coming up next?<\/h2>\n\n<p>ContinuumCloud plans to use the foundation they&rsquo;ve built to scale and grow sustainably. They&rsquo;ve brought on a new enterprise product offering and plan on putting their tech to the test.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>They&rsquo;ll be:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Tailoring their campaigns to product interest, personalizing at scale by using dynamic tags from 6sense, and dynamically populating hubs based on 6sense tags for top middle, and bottom of the funnel.<\/li>\n\t<li>Launching new predictive modeling with the 6sense platform based on a new enterprise product-level offering.<\/li>\n\t<li>Building new segmentation in Uberflip to score based on product type and route to the correct sales team based on tags and different streams that they can quickly stand up in Uberflip, segment activities, and guide prospects down the right journey.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","author":null}

The company has made extensive enhancements to its Sales Assist product, as well as debuted a new app in its marketplace called Bulk Task Smasher. Uberflip has also enriched its analytics, integrated with calendar software and video recording providers, improved in-app stability and created the ability for users to &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; their most-loved pieces of content. All of this functionality aligns with the company&rsquo;s chief priority of improving the user experience.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Uberflip is valuable in my day-to-day when sending outreach,&rdquo; said Brian O&rsquo;Connell, SDR at TripleLift, of Sales Assist. &ldquo;Rather than attaching one or more PDFs, I now have a tool where I can include or create a central resource hub for an entire team. I love it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Uberflip&rsquo;s <a href=\"https:\/\/marketplace.uberflip.com\/details\/sales-assist-1\/\" target=\"_blank\">Sales Assist<\/a> product has been a customer favorite since it first became available in 2021. The following recent changes have made it even more powerful:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Easier access to rich analytics, including important data points like how many people have viewed content, how long they viewed it, which was highest performing, and others.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li>The ability for sales reps to &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; content. This product update was inspired by customer requests, and will be extremely useful to sales teams who want to quickly find the content pieces they consider to be most valuable.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li>Enhancements to sales streams, including robust integrations with calendar software and video recording software. Now, customers can integrate a calendar call-to-action directly within their stream so a potential buyer can set up a meeting without having to leave the experience. Sales reps can also record a quick video to insert into their stream, like a welcome video that pops up to create engagement with visitors.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Also included in this launch, the <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/uberflip-blog-posts\/manage-thousands-of-content-items-easily-with-bulk-task-smasher?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=resource_center&amp;utm_content=blog\" target=\"_blank\">Bulk Task Smasher<\/a> is a notable new app in the Uberflip marketplace. Aptly named, it automates many of the formerly manual tasks that customers typically handle one at a time, like creating users and updating streams. Instead of individually tagging a subset of content to be refreshed, for example, customers can now update them in bulk with the push of a button. This new feature also makes it incredibly easy for new customers to get onboarded. The Bulk Task Smasher helps with templatization, repeatability, theme configuration and automating many of the first 100 or so tasks customers need to do. These automations help customers get up and running fast.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been using the Bulk Task Smasher internally now for a few months and have been in awe of the results,&rdquo; said Jason Dea, VP of Product at Uberflip. &ldquo;We used it for paring down our content, and saved hundreds of hours that would have been spent on this manually otherwise. We can&rsquo;t wait for our customers to get similar amounts of their valuable time back, thanks to this incredible automation tool.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>To learn more about Uberflip and these notable new capabilities, or to schedule a demo, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/request-demo?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=resource_center&amp;utm_content=blog\" target=\"_blank\">click here<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Uberflip<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Uberflip is a content experience platform that empowers marketing and sales to create engaging, relevant content destinations quickly for every campaign, audience, and stage of the customer journey.

Throughout his career, Atri has held various product-based roles that have helped him learn valuable skills and lessons.

Although there is still a clear distinction to be made between B2B and B2C marketing, the gap is closing and brands are now moving closer to H2H (Human to Human marketing). Raj used the example of Dropbox, noting that the company broke into the B2B segment by first connecting with people on a B2C level, who ended up liking the product so much that they brought it to work with them. <\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color: rgb(15, 15, 15); font-family: &quot;Sequel Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 254); text-decoration-thickness: initial;\">Surprise and delight.

Jocelyn Lo, Associate Marketing Director at TripleLift, demonstrates that the more marketing and sales work together, the more business results can improve.<\/p>\n\n<p>The overall aim of this campaign was to improve the searchability of TripleLift&rsquo;s marketing-approved content for sales. Ultimately, the ability to leverage the right content throughout the sales funnel would allow the sales team to become more agile. It would eliminate issues previously related to matching the right content with the right audience type.<\/p>\n\n<p>Jocelyn recognizes that it&#39;s easier to build on existing client relationships, but getting net-new prospects to engage is a little more challenging, soo she focussed on how she could better arm the marketing and sales voice.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How it started<\/h2>\n\n<p>Jocelyn and the team aimed to engage their targeted accounts outside of traditional, face-to-face meetings. They had an abundance of insightful materials to share, but how could they put more content in the forefront without overwhelming their clients? Enter Uberflip. By leveraging Uberflip&#39;s content tagging and Sales Assist tools, marketing helped empower sales reps to leverage marketing-approved content to build sophisticated and personalized streams for their clients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The marketing team leveraged content tags that made sense to the sales reps, so sales could easily find and hand select relevant content when using Sales Assist and building their streams. The marketing team also used templates within Sales Assist so sales could easily build upon them with customized options or add new components specific to their client.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Uberflip&#39;s <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/product-documents\/sales-assist-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Sales Assist<\/a> tool allowed reps to send an email with a single CTA that took clients to a curated stream full of relevant content. By leveraging the tagged content and templates, sales could provide a dedicated stream packaged in a personalized and easy-to-navigate way, giving each account an individual experience. The stream acted as a resource center, making it easier for their clients to share with their team vs. forwarding an email with multiple attachments, expanding sales&#39; reach further compared to traditional email. Sales reps could also update the streams in real-time when more information was required.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>TripleLift&rsquo;s sales team now have up-to-date marketing-approved resources at their fingers, providing a seamless experience and helping to consolidate materials in an engaging and easy-to-navigate way.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How it&#39;s going<\/h2>\n\n<p>Within 90 days, 73 sales reps have engaged 400 accounts with great results:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>3.6 buyers per account<\/li>\n\t<li>4.26 assets consumed per account&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li>31+ hours of engagement&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>These results provide validation that sales and marketing efforts are working. Insights such as who&#39;s engaging with the content, how long, reach, etc., also educate Jocelyn and the team on how to better support sales.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Looking ahead&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The insight into content performance has made TripleLift more aware of what content they should be creating next and more able to understand the gaps in their content or tags that they can fill.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li>They will leverage their insights to refine their content strategy and create winning content for their buyers in 2022.<\/li>\n\t<li>This project has also give TripleLift better understanding of how they can leverage Uberflip and Sales Assist to build additional use cases in the future.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n"}

Since then, and in the weeks leading up, I&rsquo;ve encountered many WTF messages while also fielding some wild rumors from my inner and outer circle as to how this came to be and what&rsquo;s next. Let me be super clear&mdash;I&rsquo;m not leaving the business (which I co-founded) or doing this to spend more time with my family (the pandemic covered me there). So why did I arrive at this massive business (and life-changing) decision? This was the right move for our business, our people and, most importantly, our customers. I&rsquo;m excited to share where we are, why I felt there was a better marketing leader for the job, and how I arrived at my new exciting title of Chief Evangelist.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Last year the average tenure of a CMO dropped to under <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedrum.com\/news\/2021\/04\/30\/cmo-tenure-slips-just-40-months-the-lowest-average-2009#:~:text=The%20average%20tenure%20of%20a,from%2030%20months%20in%202019.\" target=\"_blank\">40 months<\/a>, its lowest level since 2009. I remember being perplexed by this stat in late 2021 as I was trying to come to terms with the reality that my past VP of Marketing was resigning after just 27 months, ready to pursue the elusive CMO gig.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>I have hosted over 300 podcast episodes where I chat 1:1 with a marketer each week. The last 100 of those shows under my latest podcast, <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/1vkYBcTyIunmx3UGDG4lHg\" target=\"_blank\">The Marketer&rsquo;s Journey<\/a>, explore the path every CMO has taken to get to the executive table. I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to interview killer CMOs like Coupa&rsquo;s Chandar Pattabhiram, TripActions&rsquo; Meagen Eisenberg, and Sprout&rsquo;s Jamie Gilpin, just to name a few of my recent favs. Although each of their journeys is unique, there&rsquo;s a consistent drive to drop the more common VP for the C title. So I knew this is what people wanted&mdash;it made sense for a VP to make their move to the top, but why would I make mine and step back?<\/p>\n\n<p>As I pass the torch to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/mojomogul\/\">Ben<\/a>&nbsp;(an exceptional marketer with an accomplished journey), we happen to be at an exciting 10th anniversary since I co-founded Uberflip with Yoav. I&rsquo;ve been the CMO for five years (or 60 months or 50% longer than the average mentioned above). Obviously, we all want to beat average benchmarks (especially as marketers), but my reasoning for making this change now goes much deeper than feeling accomplished.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Right for our business:<\/h2>\n\n<p>I started to work with Yoav in 2010, a year or so before we truly had a vision for Uberflip. Truth be told, we started Uberflip in 2012 as much to create jobs for ourselves as for our passion to solve for tech. But when your startup takes off, it very quickly becomes less about you and more about the vision, your customers and your people.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>At times I have said I feel like the GM of a sports team just trying to put the right vision and people on the field to win. Like a GM, I don&rsquo;t play on game day&mdash;it&rsquo;s the players (employees), the coaches (managers) and, of course, even the fans (your customers in my analogy) who determine the win\/loss outcome. Recently, we turned to Geoffrey Moore&rsquo;s Crossing the Chasm as we were reflecting on where we were in our pursuit to win that MarTech championship (for context, Uberflip is the #1 content experience platform &rarr; CEP).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>If you haven&rsquo;t read Moore&rsquo;s timeless book or if it&rsquo;s been a while, this is a great <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shortform.com\/app\/book\/crossing-the-chasm\">modern-day Coles notes version<\/a> that succinctly outlines his findings. In a further condensed summary, the book explores:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;How innovations are adopted by different segments of society as technology matures. Moore argues that there&rsquo;s a little-recognized gap or &ldquo;chasm&rdquo; in this model between the early market and the mainstream market&mdash;and failure to cross this gap accounts for the failure of many high-tech products.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The image below is one you&rsquo;ve likely seen many times explaining the technology adoption lifecycle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MjE3YmM5YzAxODBhLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTZjMDg0NTcwOTZkMzI4MmE5NjQwMGYzYmY5M2RlYzQ3\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>It was fun looking back at our earlier stages of adoption. Moore describes the key to adoption by <strong>Innovators<\/strong> as striking a chord with people who just simply get excited about new tech and want it because it&rsquo;s new along with the promise of what&rsquo;s possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Back in 2013, one of our innovators was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jchernov\/\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Chernov<\/a> (also a past podcast guest). At the time, Joe was already known as somewhat of a visionary for his work at Eloqua. Joe has since become a 3x CMO, including his current leadership at rocketship Pendo. Back in 2013 at Content Marketing World, Joe presented a vision of the future of content, including highlighting us as a way to package &ldquo;the never-ending asset&rdquo;. I remember being so obsessed with his take of our efforts. The vision and input of innovators like Joe have helped propel our vision in so many ways beyond our MVP.<\/p>\n\n<p>A few of Joe&rsquo;s slides can be flipped through below:<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MjE3YmM4ZjM5ZmI4LmdpZiZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTg2YjdlZjZjYjVjOTU0ZTUwOGI4YzllOGMyZTU2YjYy\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky to progress along the cycle to gain <strong>Early Adopters<\/strong>, Moore explains that they tick a bit differently. They have a vision of their own and motivation to implement your tech to get ahead of the herd. We were fortunate to have some amazing visionaries like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/danielgday\/\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Day<\/a> at Snowflake who, at the time, described how he had the vision to use our tech in ways we hadn&rsquo;t even been able to articulate. The ~1 minute clip from an interview below was so insightful to me and our team at the time, revealing how he was &ldquo;hacking away&rdquo; to scale his vision. His hacks became future product releases.<\/p>\n<script src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.com\/embed\/medias\/n1k230ru4y.jsonp\" async><\/script><script src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.com\/assets\/external\/E-v1.js\" async><\/script>\n\n<div class=\"wistia_responsive_padding\" style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\">\n<div class=\"wistia_responsive_wrapper\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;\">\n<div class=\"wistia_embed wistia_async_n1k230ru4y videoFoam=true\" style=\"height:100%;position:relative;width:100%\">\n<div class=\"wistia_swatch\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;\"><img alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" onload=\"this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;\" src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.com\/embed\/medias\/n1k230ru4y\/swatch\" style=\"filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>But as I said, it&rsquo;s been a decade, and we have progressed significantly with the business. The category we coined had gained significant traction from analysts, partners and, most importantly, customers. When trying to plot our latest advancement in the cycle we knew we had no issues winning in the Early Market and had shown numerous signs of ability to cross the chasm into the <strong>Early Majority<\/strong>. The key to selling into the Early Majority is leading with messaging around how your solution is safe, easy and leading the way. This type of messaging is key to a more pragmatic business buyer who wants to stay with the herd. For many companies, this means you&rsquo;re moving into the mass market with scale and I was confident we were ready for this.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>At Uberflip we have successfully worked with amazing companies like Amazon, Hexagon, and Medtronic. These are companies that I would respectfully label as needing Early Majority messaging. That said, we often managed to land in their organizations because an Early Market visionary worked within. Take Hexagon, a global leader in digital reality solutions. One of our Early Adopters, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jodilebow\/\" target=\"_blank\">Jodi Lebow<\/a>, had recently joined this company. Jodi championed us with her&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>vision earlier in her career at multiple high-growth startups (that were moreso in the Early Market) before bringing our tech into the 21k-employee, publicly traded force that is Hexagon.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Contemplating what it would take to land at Hexagon without Jodi and her involvement has served to me as a great example of why I was ready to both pass the CMO torch and jump into a full-time evangelism role.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>I have no doubt that, without Jodi&rsquo;s assurances, we would not have landed into Hexagon as smoothly as we did. Despite their scale and needs, we proved (with her assurance) that the partnership could deliver amazing returns on both ends&mdash;and it has. We were continually proving this in companies like Jodi&rsquo;s <u>when we got the chance<\/u>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>This was an exciting signal. But, we needed a CMO who could better line up our GTM, including marketing messaging and sales motion to ensure we could <u>repeatedly and at scale<\/u> show this potential to the rest of our TAM (total addressable market). Simply put, this was not my forte. Templating that shift for scale was the job for a marketing leader that had done so and was ready to scale. I was confident this experience would ensure our business could make the jump over the chasm at true scale without falling back.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Right for our business and me:<\/h2>\n\n<p>As much as I saw my gap, I also recognized my strength in our partnership with success stories like Jodi&rsquo;s and those of others who sit on our customer advisory board. I thrive working 1:1 with champions like these to learn how we can make an experience better and highlight the win.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>If you look to the most basic of definitions of a marketing or a tech evangelist (like the one from <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Evangelism_marketing\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia<\/a>), you get &ldquo;an advanced form of word-of-mouth marketing in which companies develop customers who believe so strongly in a particular product or service that they freely try to convince others to buy and use it.&rdquo; What I absolutely love to do is connect and engage with marketers to learn what they&rsquo;re doing, either to help them or simply learn from them. This angle has been such a key to me becoming a better marketer and, in some cases, connecting other marketers to do the same from each other.<\/p>\n\n<p>Earlier this month, as I was working on this post in my head, I was fortunate to jump on a call with two amazing ABM leaders, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/hillarycarpio\/\" target=\"_blank\">Hillary<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/amber-bogie\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amber<\/a>. Our purpose for the call was to plan a panel discussion at a big upcoming conference. We got the panel agenda taken care of in about 5% of the time we had scheduled. The rest of the call was simply educational for all of us. In the follow-up I heard feedback thanking me for making our chat &ldquo;refreshing&rdquo; and &ldquo;candid&rdquo;. The reality is the two of them made the convo just that. <strong>I just got to be the bridge<\/strong>. This is the form of evangelism I believe is most powerful: not my voice, but the elevation and bridging of the voices of our community.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, the premise of engaging with our customers is one of our six corporate core values.

Those moments of LUV have served to guide product development, our messaging, and my personal grasp of modern-day marketing challenges.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>As I&rsquo;ve realized the opportunity we have in bringing in a new CMO, I also recognize the potential for our company where my full time could be placed as our Chief Evangelist. I&rsquo;ll be honest&mdash;not everyone grasps the title. A family member asked if this meant I had become more religious and was becoming a preacher. That was a fun convo. The term evangelism actually comes from Greek history and the three words &#39;bringing good news&#39;. This is my goal: to bring good news to you every day. It could be a customer story you could learn from or a simple upbeat thought to get you out of a rut.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Some of the chief evangelists I&rsquo;ve admired from a distance include Guy Kawaski and his role in Apple&rsquo;s early rise (and more recently for Canva), Dan&rsquo;s role at Gainsight, and my friend Sangram&rsquo;s role at Terminus. What excites me about all of these examples is the companies behind them have maintained not just success, but leadership in their categories. I believe this success is not just because of the voice of one person, like Guy at Apple, but the trickle of advocacy that comes from an evangelist&rsquo;s reach to activate a community.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>When I co-founded Uberflip, we decided to tackle a problem that many marketers could not articulate well on day one: What happens after you create great content? The answer has been demonstrated by many amazing marketers, including those mentioned in this post: Create a great experience. In 2019 I wrote my first book, <a href=\"https:\/\/geni.us\/MA5p\" target=\"_blank\">F#ck Content Marketing<\/a>, which became an Amazon Bestseller. It reflected years of interactions and learning about the value of focusing on content experience. At the time, I felt like I packed the book with every detail that I needed to be shared. But now, I&rsquo;m even more excited about the next chapter. Our business now has a marketing leader who can scale us into the mainstream market. And, as for me, I can&rsquo;t wait to bring good news and help as many of you as possible focus on the experience in your GTM.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n"}

An organized hub with well-tagged content makes it easier to boost the discoverability of those fantastically insightful pieces you&rsquo;ve created. Uberflip&rsquo;s tools can help automate processes that you&rsquo;d usually spend heaps of manual time managing and categorizing. The less time you spend manually doing tasks such as tagging, the more time you have to spend on strategy and insights. What&rsquo;s more, it makes your library easy to scale as your company grows. So what tools and features do we offer to enable content marketers to do this at scale? We&rsquo;re glad you asked:<\/p>\n\n<h3>Make global changes to content in mere minutes<\/h3>\n\n<p>From one content team to another, the <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/product-documents\/bulk-task-smasher-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Bulk Task Smasher (BTS)<\/a> is a gift from the Uberflip gods and a joy to use, especially when you&rsquo;re undergoing a <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/content-marketing\/content-audit-template\" target=\"_blank\">content audit<\/a>! This new app, available in the <a href=\"https:\/\/marketplace.uberflip.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Uberflip Marketplace<\/a>, helps eliminate the repetitive manual tasks that eat up so much of your time. With BTS you can edit, create, tag, and delete content in bulk. Not only does it save you time but BTS empowers you to clear out the clutter in your hub which helps increase your high-value content&rsquo;s discoverability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3>Organize your hub with automatic smart filters<\/h3>\n\n<p>With us being so passionate about content organization, it&rsquo;s no surprise that, here at Uberflip, we&rsquo;ve taken it to the next level with, *drumroll*&hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/help.uberflip.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360022891612-Use-Smart-Filters-to-automate-content-workflows\" target=\"_blank\">Smart filters<\/a>! These AI-powered filters allow you to automate your content management, sorting, and tagging workflows. It allows you to automatically apply pre-decided rules to content, speeding up content organization across your entire library. Smart filters allow you to apply one or more actions such as adding or removing from streams, tagging, and more, helping to reduce the manual effort of organizing and managing your hub by automating your content management workflows.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Break down silos and create one source of truth<\/h2>\n\n<p>One of the biggest challenges as a content marketer is managing multiple versions of the same piece of content living in different places&mdash;it can be an absolute nightmare! Having multiple versions can make it impossible to ensure content is up to date, but having one centralized location, one source of truth, makes it easy for branding and content updates to be implemented. What&rsquo;s even better? Having a single source inspires confidence in your customer-facing teams that the binge-worthy content experiences they&#39;re sharing are filled with the most up-to-date versions.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Organize and integrate your content into dedicated hubs<\/h3>\n\n<p>By organizing your content into an Uberflip hub, you&rsquo;re creating a single source of truth that every customer-facing team member can access. You no longer have to worry whether your teams are still deploying old versions of content, as everyone will be accessing it from the same place. But it doesn&rsquo;t stop there! We&rsquo;ve got your content living outside of the hub covered too! Uberflip enables you to <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/uberflip-blog-posts\/how-uberflip-integrates-with-your-tech-stack\" target=\"_blank\">integrate third-party content platforms<\/a> such as RSS, SlideShare, Wistia, Vidyard, and more, to break down content silos for more control across platforms. This makes it quick and easy for all the relevant teams to build out content streams, with no need for logging in and out of other platforms or downloading and reuploading content. It&#39;s all in one easy to use, organized, location.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Create and edit content directly with the Uberflip blog editor<\/h3>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve said it once and we&rsquo;ll say it again: goodbye to flicking back and forth between platforms to write and publish your content! Take control of drafting, editing, and publishing blogs, right within the hub. It&rsquo;s so simple to edit every aspect of a blog, from the title to the URL slug. You can even create articles to support assets like ebooks and videos with ease, and replace whole ebooks or even just single pages to simplify version control, with no need to reupload a new ebook each time. All this can be done within the same platform. Not only does all this save you time, but it also maintains one source of truth. With only one version existing it makes rendering updates a lot easier and avoids having multiple versions floating around. Music to our ears.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Accelerate your buyer journey&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Internal organization is a critical part of the process but, when it comes down to it, our goal is to <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/accelerate-your-buyers-journey-by-dynamically-curating-relevant-content\/forrester-report-accelerate-your-buyers-journey-by-dynamically-curating-relevant-content\" target=\"_blank\">accelerate our buyer journey<\/a> and grow pipeline.

Well, don&rsquo;t worry, Uberflip&rsquo;s got your back there too:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3>Measure content success and ROI with insights<\/h3>\n\n<p>There&#39;s only one way for you to drive content success, and that&rsquo;s with in-depth, holistic, insights.

You can also leverage preset dashboards or create custom reports specific to your business needs&mdash;and so much more!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3>Make your customers feel at home with scalable personalization<\/h3>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/ebook\/the-experience-disconnect\" target=\"_blank\">Content Experience Disconnect Report<\/a> shows that buyers want content personalized to their problems and content they might be interested in.

Whether it&rsquo;s onboarding, growing awareness, or gaining advocates, retaining and engaging your customers is the key to success.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Great content experiences aren&#39;t just for buyers, converting leads, or growing pipe. Customer marketers can also use content experiences to build loyalty, support education, and for customer expansion.

With Uberflip&rsquo;s marketing streams, you can achieve this through white-glove customer service&mdash;namely binge-worthy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/features\/personalization\/\" target=\"_blank\">personalized content experiences<\/a> that require little manual effort.

While email is a great outreach tool, people&rsquo;s inboxes are often full of clutter so you must make sure that you stay top of mind by ensuring your valuable content isn&#39;t getting buried in a mountain of unread emails. The better way to do that is with a dynamic content destination that can be bookmarked by the customer. With Uberflip&#39;s marketing streams you can reduce customer email fatigue while ensuring they&rsquo;re still getting access to all the content they need through a self-service portal they can refer back to anytime.<\/p>\n\n<p>Marketing streams can be used to promote onboarding, awareness, or advocacy.

When it came time for her to jump into a new role, Stacey was wise enough to remove her ego from the equation. Although she held the coveted CEO title in her previous role, she didn&rsquo;t hesitate to move back into the CMO role when she was presented with a position that checked all the most important boxes: great people, a product she was passionate about and a huge market opportunity.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li>It&rsquo;s all about the people. Whether she&rsquo;s working at a company of 500 or 5,000 people, Stacey&rsquo;s commitment to prioritizing her team remains. She believes that no matter what title you hold, your most important job is to ensure everyone on the team, from managers to frontline employees, is thriving.<\/li>\n\t<li>CMOs make great CEOs. Since they typically have experience working with the organization&rsquo;s head of sales, HR and finance, CMOs are tasked with the same type of coordination work that&rsquo;s required in the CEO role. In the future, we&rsquo;ll likely continue to see more marketers making the jump into executive leadership roles.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Learn more about Freshworks <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshworks.com\/\u00a0\">here<\/a>.<br \/>\nLearn more about Stacey <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/staceyepstein\/\">here<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n"}

When asked which departments have ABM accountability other than the ABM lead, Uberflip customer Katerina Maerefat from OpenSesame states: &ldquo;All departments need to be aligned to successfully launch ABM campaigns and efforts. This is key to success.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Creating a unified team that shares buyer engagement knowledge creates a more connected and consistent buyer experience. You can deliver the seamless, curated content experience your buyer craves with less effort when your entire team is brought into the same go-to-market strategy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Creating a connected experience for your buyers requires a lot of internal teamwork but the benefits are well worth the legwork! But breaking down silos within the team can be challenging and may require new best practices or even a paradigm shift in how your teams work together. You can better streamline processes, share knowledge, and reduce redundancy in your tech stack. Once you receive buy-in from your go-to-market team, you&rsquo;ll resolve common roadblocks such as <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/uberflip-blog-posts\/leverage-tech-to-scale-abm-improve-your-abm-strategy-to-deliver-connected-experiences\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">lack of resources<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/uberflip-blog-posts\/what-a-customer-first-experience-can-achieve-improve-your-abm-strategy-to-deliver-connected-experiences\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">insufficient data<\/a> simply by changing the way you work together.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Open collaboration on buyer insights will increase your ABM program&#39;s success.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Cross-functional collaboration for a more cohesive buyer journey<\/h2>\n\n<p>Aligning teams creates a smoother customer experience where handoffs between marketing and sales are as natural as breathing. <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/ebook\/the-experience-disconnect\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">Uberflip&rsquo;s research shows<\/a> there&rsquo;s a disconnect between what buyers want versus what B2B marketers provide. More than half (56%) of marketers are most focused on delivering personalization based on basic information, such as the customer&rsquo;s name, company, or industry. According to buyers, personalization needs to be based on &ldquo;the problem I&rsquo;m looking to solve&rdquo; and &ldquo;content I might be interested in&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>While ABM isn&rsquo;t a new concept, today&rsquo;s technology is making it easier to target accounts online with personalized content experiences, at scale, through multiple channels. Buyers want relevance when they&rsquo;re searching for answers to their challenges. Having marketing and sales working on accounts together builds a clearer picture of the challenges an account is facing and what type of content is most relevant to them. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forrester.com\/report\/b2b-needs-to-move-beyond-demand-and-abm\/RES177450\" target=\"_blank\">Forrester&rsquo;s report<\/a> states that: &ldquo;The silos that have typically existed between demand and ABM, for example, inhibit potential breakthrough thinking aimed at driving smarter demand and intelligent revenue growth.&rdquo; If you want to increase the effectiveness of your ABM strategy and create a more cohesive journey for your buyers, you need to ensure your entire marketing team is aligned on the ideal customer, messaging, tactics, and timing to capture demand.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Engage the whole team to implement and scale personalized ABM as just one GTM strategy<\/h2>\n\n<p>The idea that ABM is a shared responsibility with the ABM lead at the helm, versus their sole responsibility, can elevate your ABM strategies. As Babe Ruth said, &quot;The way a team plays as a whole determines its success.&rdquo; To gain real momentum and success with ABM, you need buy-in and collaboration from your entire marketing and sales teams. By getting your teams on the same page, you&rsquo;ll be able to identify efficiencies while simultaneously streamlining your buyer journey&mdash;two birds, one stone.<\/p>\n\n<p>Implementing your ABM strategy requires defined roles and responsibilities within marketing teams to smooth out the handoffs at key points of the buyer journey.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/request-demo\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">Speak to an expert today<\/a> to find out how Uberflip can help all channels improve your ABM strategy.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Methodology<\/h3>\n\n<p><strong>Marketers survey:<\/strong><br \/>\nUberflip surveyed 250 US-based marketers at the manager level or above in mid-February 2022.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Buyers survey:<\/strong><br \/>\nUberflip surveyed 250 US-based B2B buyers in early February 2022.

The challenge might be related to the <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/ebook\/the-experience-disconnect\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">disconnect<\/a> between what marketers create as content experiences and what buyers expect. When asked, B2B buyers said they&#39;re more likely to engage with personalized content. But what does personalization mean to a buyer? Content needs to be based on the problem buyers are looking to solve. A few years back, personalized email greetings were the holy grail of a personalized experience. Today, personalization is more complex&mdash;it now needs to speak to an entire buying team, not just one person.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>When it comes to satisfying your buyers&rsquo; needs with content, creating a content experience based on known pain points accelerates the journey. Identifying accounts is a good start for ABM. But it&rsquo;s exactly that: the start. So what would happen if you took a step back and created a content experience based on buyer pain points and the ways your product can help solve them?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Achieve the gold standard for personalization&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>An integral part of ABM is engagement and putting the right content in front of the right buyer at the right time. <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/ebook\/the-experience-disconnect\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">Buyers said<\/a> boring or irrelevant content is the most frustrating part of researching. Testing and learning what topics and formats your buyers engage with most are vital to creating that customer-first experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Matching content to your buyer is step one. Marketing and sales teams must also align on customer profiles and personas so there is agreement on what content and messaging should be served up. When asked what tools marketers use for their ABM programs, social media management tools were number one, with 64% of marketers leveraging them. While marketers can target segmented audiences with relevant messaging on social and search, you could create a disappointing content experience when the destination the buyer clicks through to isn&rsquo;t aligned to the message that first attracted them and, worse, isn&#39;t relevant to the problems they&rsquo;re looking to solve. The more you break down the data and role barriers between your ABM lead, sales, and other marketing departments to <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/uberflip-blog-posts\/engage-the-entire-team-improve-your-abm-strategy-to-deliver-connected-experiences\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">become the go-to-market team<\/a>, the more consistent the messaging and the better the buyer experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Gaining insights and understanding what content resonates best allows you to provide more relevant content, which means you&rsquo;ll earn the buyer&rsquo;s trust faster, ultimately moving them down the funnel quicker. You can achieve success when you curate a branded experience with content your buyers need based on what they&rsquo;ve engaged with previously. ContinuumCloud did this perfectly with their <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/customer-stories\/demand-generation-and-abm-campaign-that-increased-pipeline-by-267\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">ABM campaign that increased pipeline by 267%<\/a>. The team couldn&rsquo;t create true 1:1 messaging for each of their accounts, but they wanted it to feel 1:1 to the buyers. They took cues from prospects to understand what and how much content was engaged with. Building off of that helped them to create a tailored experience with Uberflip. They used sales streams and dynamic tags and included logos to make their marketing efforts scalable without losing that essential personalization.<\/p>\n\n<p>By leveraging intent data to target the right accounts, and with the right <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/content-experience-platform\/\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">content experience platform<\/a>, you can create a personalized content destination that serves up decision-enabling content and encourages self-nurturing&mdash;which is fundamental to engaging your buyers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Eliminate data silos and fragmentation across the buyer journey&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Gaining a holistic view of content performance data is a challenge for the majority of B2B marketers and impacts the ability to know your audiences and to serve up the right content&mdash;especially when it&rsquo;s likely your teams have separate reporting based on their favorite (vanity) metrics. Over half (56%) of marketers said &ldquo;better data&rdquo; would have the most impact on their ability to run a successful ABM program. Without the ability to compel your buyer to engage, you have little chance of accelerating the journey and a higher chance of frustrating prospects. Data informs your entire team and you need insights throughout the journey and from all parts of the marketing team to build a holistic picture.<\/p>\n\n<p>With more in-depth insights, sales and marketers can create:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Better-targeted ads<\/li>\n\t<li>More engaging sales outreach&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li>Topics that best meet the buyer where they are in their journey&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Your team receives quantitative and qualitative feedback on what kind of engagement your content experiences are getting, so make sure you&rsquo;re leveraging both to get a holistic picture. A combination of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/features\/analytics-reporting\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">content analytics<\/a> and collaboration with your sales team can provide insight into the content that is working best and is most helpful to your buyers at the different stages in their journey. When sales and marketing teams collaborate through consistent data, they can support one another, enabling relevant and timely conversations and campaigns that truly resonate with the buyer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Snowflake provides a great example of how collaboration on content insights can power pipeline success. Their marketing team worked closely with sales to curate content based on conversations with prospects. Marketing then coupled human intelligence with data insights leveraged from modern-day technologies, like the integration between Uberflip and 6sense, to power their <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/customer-stories\/abm-campaign-that-increased-average-deal-size-by-2-5x-2\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">ABM campaign that increased the average deal size by 2.5x<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What a customer-first experience can achieve<\/h2>\n\n<p>Breaking down silos between teams and marrying machine learning with human intelligence will help you better map out the buyer journey and provide a consistent experience. Your entire team needs to be aligned on goals and messaging. If the content and messaging you&rsquo;re serving up to your buyer isn&rsquo;t consistent, relevant to their stage in the journey, and personalized to their pains, prospects&rsquo; engagement will drop off, and this disconnect will ultimately prevent them from moving down the funnel.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/request-demo\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">Speak to an expert today<\/a> to find out how Uberflip can help you implement a customer-first experience to improve your ABM strategy.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Methodology<\/h3>\n\n<p><strong>Marketers survey:<\/strong><br \/>\nUberflip surveyed 250 US-based marketers at the manager level or above in mid-February 2022.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Buyers survey:<\/strong><br \/>\nUberflip surveyed 250 US-based B2B buyers in early February 2022.

Implementing an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/solutions\/account-based-marketing\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">account-based marketing (ABM)<\/a> strategy has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forrester.com\/report\/Forrester-Infographic-ABM-Maturity-Corresponds-To-Better-Revenue-Results\/RES157155\" target=\"_blank\">clear revenue benefits<\/a>, so it&#39;s no surprise that two-thirds of B2B marketers said they have embraced ABM as their go-to-market strategy. We haven&rsquo;t cracked the code just yet&mdash;the main barrier cited by those who don&rsquo;t utilize ABM was &ldquo;lack of resources&rdquo; but 57% of marketers who do use ABM also said &ldquo;more resources to support&rdquo; would make the biggest impact on successfully running their campaigns. The answer isn&rsquo;t more ABM tools but, rather, how to get more out of your tools. One of the most important aspects of scaling ABM efforts is how to effectively use your tech stack.<\/p>\n\n<p>Developing 1:1 campaigns can take quite a bit of time&mdash;something that busy, lean marketing teams don&#39;t have. In this blog, we&rsquo;ll showcase how you can make better use of your tech stack to tackle your resource issues and maximize the success of your ABM strategies.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Leverage tech to scale efficiently<\/h2>\n\n<p>Scaling relevant content for tens, hundreds, or even thousands of accounts requires fewer tools than you might think. When we talk about having the right ABM tools in your tech stack, we&rsquo;re referring to the key tech every ABM campaign needs to:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Identify your target accounts with tools such as a Marketing automation platform (MAP) or customer relationship management system (CRM)<\/li>\n\t<li>Attract your accounts, whether that&#39;s through ads or email<\/li>\n\t<li>Engage your accounts with <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/uberflip-blog-posts\/how-to-empower-your-sales-team-with-sales-assist\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">sales engagement tools<\/a> to captivate your accounts or a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/content-experience-platform\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">content experience platform (CEP)<\/a> to keep your target accounts engaged.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Customer experience journey\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MmQwNzUxODRjZGQ0LnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTAyYjdkMzMyMTE2NTZkMDIzOTczNTY1NzZkN2VlMGJi\" \/>The key to an efficient tech stack is choosing tech partners that integrate to provide you with more capability, greater automation, and deeper insights. Implementing the best tech for your business leads to better business outcomes, as Degreed demonstrated with their ABM campaign that <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/customer-stories\/amber-bogie-degreed\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">generated $3.4M in pipeline in three months<\/a>. They did this by targeting specific accounts with general messaging on ads served on LinkedIn or through Terminus. The ads drove accounts to an Uberflip content destination where the buyer self-selected the pain point that resonated best and read content relevant to their business challenges. Degreed demonstrated the effects of leveraging the right tech to reach the 1:many objective of their marketing goal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Make your tech stack work harder<\/h2>\n\n<p>Before you sign up for the latest tech, audit your current stack and assess whether you can get more out of your existing systems. Chances are you already have everything (or close to it) that you need. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, let&rsquo;s take a few ABM tools that marketers commonly use in their tech stacks: a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/content-experience-platform\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">CEP<\/a>, a MAP, and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/supercharge-your-cms-with-uberflip\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">content management system (CMS)<\/a>. Alone, each tool used for ABM performs a specific function to bring the ABM strategy to life. If these tools exist in your tech stack, you can supercharge your ABM campaign by connecting the tools in your stack. You don&rsquo;t need anything new! Our partner 6sense provides one example of how tool integration connects the dots. Using journey-based campaigns, 6sense sent viewers to a personalized content destination within Uberflip and <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/customer-stories\/the-abm-campaign-that-increased-pageviews-by-31-2\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">increased page views by 31%<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Integrating your tech stack allows you to <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/product-documents\/uberflip-enrichment-overview\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">enrich content performance data<\/a> by connecting buyer data from your MAP to engagement metrics and connecting the dots on how your customers interact with your content. One way to do this is by integrating your MAP and your CEP. In addition to surfacing a fuller picture of your buyers, integrating a CEP and MAP allows you to:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Create better-personalized experiences<\/li>\n\t<li>Accelerate the buyer journey and measure the results<\/li>\n\t<li>Continually optimize your content experiences in real time, anticipating the needs of the buying team and serving the right content at the right time<\/li>\n\t<li>Provide sales teams with fully warmed-up accounts and insights on the buyer and their journey.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>A CEP provides those all-important details like what content works across accounts and what content is popular within an account so you can provide the content that best answers the questions of the various roles on the buying team. When you add a CEP to your tech stack, you can drastically reduce the time it takes to implement changes based on those insights and allow more time to refine your content destinations and better engage your buyers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>What you can achieve with an integrated tech stack&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>While the success of your ABM campaigns shouldn&rsquo;t rest solely on technology, it&rsquo;s crucial to recognize there isn&rsquo;t just one tool or platform that can deliver your entire ABM strategy. A lean marketing team can become more powerful and efficient with the right tools&mdash;not more tools. Tool integration allows you to build and scale your strategy without additional manual effort, or new tools. An integrated tech stack can open up new doors for you&mdash; as opposed to loading up on the newest and shiniest available tech.<\/p>\n\n<p>Make your tech stack work smarter, not harder. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/request-demo\/?utm_medium=uberflip-hub&amp;utm_source=uberflip-blog&amp;utm_content=blog-post\" target=\"_blank\">Speak to an expert today<\/a> to find out how Uberflip can help you leverage the right tech to improve your ABM strategy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3>Methodology<\/h3>\n\n<p><strong>Marketers survey:<\/strong><br \/>\nUberflip surveyed 250 US-based marketers at the manager level or above in mid-February 2022.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Buyers survey:<\/strong><br \/>\nUberflip surveyed 250 US-based B2B buyers in early February 2022.

More resources, more team members, more technology, more budget, more hours in the day. We could always use more - and sometimes? We even get it (thank you, finance!). But other times, we have to make do with what we have. Regardless of our company&rsquo;s growth trajectory, this will be the case for us more often than not.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Even so, &lsquo;making do&rsquo; in general is very different from having to make do in the midst of an actual recession. It&rsquo;s been 13 years since that scary little word was whispered and, given the timeline, was probably while most of your current workforce was still in university or even elementary school. Now that another imminent recession is being predicted, how do you plan to handle your marketing through the storm? Here&rsquo;s some help. But first&hellip;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Economics from a marketer&rsquo;s perspective<\/h2>\n\n<p>In between the last recession and the present day, we got a taste of a bear market in 2020 (that&rsquo;s a prolonged period of price declines in a stock or entire market, usually of 20% or more from a recent high). But, it only lasted a little more than a month. Contrast that with the bear market in 2008-2009, where the market fell more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/select\/what-is-a-bear-market-how-its-affecting-your-portfolio\/\">50% over a span of 408 days<\/a> (side note - 408 days is extremely long; the average bear market is 289 days).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m aware this all sounds like a bunch of doom and gloom, but it&rsquo;s important to paint a clear picture of what may be ahead and how the business world is likely to react. Typically, when business leaders fear this type of market, there&rsquo;s a trickle down effect that occurs. Fear causes a reduction in consumer spending, which reduces the value of companies, which catalyzes a reduction in their expenses - and so it continues. In these times we need to be ready to do more with less. I know this sounds insane, unreasonable and unfair all at once. But it&rsquo;s happened before and we need to be prepared.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, the above is a very simplified explanation as I&#39;m a marketer, not an economist. But being a marketer, my mind instantly goes to how I will retain and grow my customer base in the 289 or so rough days ahead. Basically, what is my new go-to-market (GTM) motion? Where should I invest or double down? And yes, where should I make cuts?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>What can be done?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Now, like many of your workforce members, I was not in the marketing driver&rsquo;s seat back in 2008. I was in marketing, but taking direction from other mentors and leaders. So with these questions in mind, I spoke with some great CMOs who have navigated a bear market before to get their advice. These people were all in the driver seat (either VP or CMO level at some very impressive companies) during the last notable recession. I was fortunate to chat with:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/events\/b2b\/connect15\/speakers\/elissa-fink\">Elissa Fink<\/a> - CMO of Tableau in 2008 (for 12 years total)<\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/meageneisenberg\/\">Meagen Eisenberg<\/a> - Director at ArcSight, which was acquired by HP in 2008 and since VP at DocuSign and current CMO at TripActions &nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/peterisaacson\/\">Peter Isaacson<\/a> - VP at Adobe during 2008 recession and since CMO at Demandbase and now Replicant<\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/brian-kardon-446b4\/\">Brian Kardon<\/a> - Started as CMO of Eloqua, acquired by Oracle just before Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. Has since led at companies like InVision, Fuze and Lattice Engines.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>These leaders have all been there and done that in times we can&rsquo;t imagine. Here are some of the key takeaways from our conversations.<\/p>\n\n<h2>1. Be the Chief Optimist&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Both Elissa Fink and Peter Isaacson agree that maintaining an optimistic outlook is key to success during a tough economic time. But, they also went out of their way to emphasize the importance of pairing it with pragmatism. Piggybacking off of this wisdom, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d recommend:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>Hold regular team meetings<\/em>, as well as one-on-one meetings so your employees have the chance to ask honest questions and share their concerns. Side note: different meetings are needed with your direct reports versus the team as a whole if you&rsquo;ve got layers.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li><em>Be transparent<\/em>. Acknowledge the reality of the facts to your team, and then buoy their spirits with confidence that you&rsquo;ll get through this time together.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li><em>Use clear messaging<\/em> so your words don&rsquo;t get distorted through an office game of broken-telephone\/Slack, and reinforce that people still need your product. This helps your team feel confident that you&rsquo;ll ultimately emerge from this stronger.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>2. Go All-In on Revenue Generation&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Every CMO I connected with stressed the need to fund strategies that directly support revenue during an economic downturn. Brian Kardon said that what matters most in these times are tactics related to pipeline, like campaigns, product marketing efforts, SEM and SEO. Brian also said during the last recession, he and his team focused more on customer marketing. In his words, &ldquo;We wanted to make sure our current customers felt really good about us because they&rsquo;re the closest route to upsell expansion referral business.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Peter seconded this by saying to &ldquo;keep investing in landing and expanding customers.&rdquo; In other words, don&rsquo;t make cuts in the areas of customer acquisition and maintenance, because you need to keep your pipeline going. He said that once the deal flow stops, a company usually starts cutting salespeople, which then restricts deal flow even more, leading into what he&rsquo;s termed a &ldquo;spiral of doom.&rdquo; Avoid the spiral by putting your efforts into your pipeline.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition, I suggest the following if you want to prioritize revenue generation:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Consider whether some (but not all) <em>brand-based advertising<\/em> should be cut.<\/li>\n\t<li>Ensure you have <em>revenue attribution<\/em> through a combination of your marketing automation platform and attribution modeling (e.g. via systems like Bizible or Qualified). &nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li>Within the former, in these times knowing <em>what content<\/em> is informing your customers is key so make sure you have tracking built into your content experience (e.g. platforms like Uberflip)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>3. Get Focused on What Moves the Needle<\/h2>\n\n<p>Elissa emphasized going back to your core priorities. Maybe you had ten originally outlined for the year but, given the rocky circumstances, it&rsquo;s wise to narrow it down to the top three that make the biggest impact. Any initiatives that aren&rsquo;t connected to those three priorities are free to be cut, while you should plan to &ldquo;double down on anything you can to boost your revenue and pipeline priorities.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>I second this, and also recommend that you:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Use your <em>attribution model<\/em> to guide how you prioritize.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li>Make sure you have a <em>project management<\/em> software like Asana or Monday.com in place so your team is in the loop about what the priorities are. These are relatively affordable and worth leaning into.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li>Be prepared to push <em>back on behalf of your team<\/em>, if they&rsquo;re asked to do too much (or too much outside of their comfort zone).&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>4. Put Your Scrappy Marketer Hat On<\/h2>\n\n<p>Elissa advised viewing a downturn as a challenge. She said to use it as a time to brainstorm and get creative about different ways you and your team can increase efficiency and go &ldquo;guerilla&rdquo; on your marketing efforts. Brian echoed this sentiment, saying times like this force you to become disciplined in order to do more with less. He said that &ldquo;having guardrails actually helps you become more creative,&rdquo; which is ultimately a silver lining.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>From my perspective, this also means you should:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Leverage your existing customers, and seek to put them first.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li>Leverage your existing technology (in other words, can you use the tools you have in place more thoughtfully and productively, to get more ROI?).<\/li>\n\t<li>We&rsquo;re often tempted to cut things like tech as opposed to first looking to see if the silver bullet is right in front of us but not yet being leveraged. This could even be a person who refocused on a different project and should not be terminated.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>5. Nurture Your Database with Relevant Content&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Elissa and Meagen both mentioned the value of continuing to create and distribute content, as you&rsquo;re exploring channels to keep versus cut. Content is a cost-effective tactic that also serves buyers when they&rsquo;re ready to be served. There&rsquo;s great power in delivering a content experience that meets buyers where they are in their journey with your brand and offers them truly relevant information.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;d take this further and advise companies to move away from ad spend during economic uncertainty and invest more time and energy into nurturing your existing database. Rather than trying to acquire new customers, make cuts in tactics (like advertising) so you can keep more of your people and put your focus on waking the dead (dormant customers). Not only is this cost-effective, but it&rsquo;s also a smart way to allocate your resources in lean budget times.<\/p>\n\n<p>Honestly, solving these problems is a big part of why I co-founded Uberflip. There&rsquo;s not a single campaign that works all year long every year because circumstances change, so marketers need to be able to surface the right content in order to reach a specific goal. &nbsp;With that, here are some key takeaways I&rsquo;ve added on this one:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>Centralize, organize and tag<\/em> your content, so you can be nimble and pull what you need when you need it.<\/li>\n\t<li>Having content for marketing campaigns is just half the battle.<em> Ensure your sales reps and CSMs have access to the right content<\/em> in minutes for their outreach.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li><em>Focus on the experience!<\/em> Line up the content assets that are relevant so that your buyers can discover at their pace versus the drip you want to force. This never works and especially in these times.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>6. Shift Your Tone to Reflect the Times<\/h2>\n\n<p>On the topic of content, it&rsquo;s important to also remember that your tone matters. Be sure that the content you&rsquo;re surfacing and sharing doesn&rsquo;t come across as flippant or disrespectful of today&rsquo;s current environment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, a piece of content from economically abundant times wouldn&rsquo;t be appropriate in the here and now, and could come across as callous, arrogant or alienating. Meagen Eisenberg recommends viewing new and old content through the lens of how buyers are feeling in this moment, and adjusting your tone to meet them there.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Meagen currently works in the travel industry and spoke to the need to completely adjust the tone of her content in 2020 when the pandemic hit. She expects the same tweaks will be needed in a downturn and feels her team is ready to embrace that challenge.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>So with that:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>Determine the message<\/em> or campaign your team will rally around for these times and what your audience wants to hear in the months ahead.<\/li>\n\t<li><em>Take time to audit your content<\/em> and even sunset assets that no longer apply.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>7. Shift Your Account-Based Marketing (ABM) Practices into Higher Gear<\/h2>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been dabbling in ABM, or maybe aren&rsquo;t fully invested yet, now is the time to take the strategy more seriously. In fact, ABM is completely built upon the idea of getting extremely focused and spending the bulk of your time and resources on the accounts and buyers that can yield the biggest impact. What could make more sense during shaky economic times?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>To this end, consider where your ABM relationship currently stands. Do you have an account-based platform, but aren&rsquo;t fully utilizing it? Or have you been waiting to get such a platform out of fear of the change it will require? This can be one area where investing into the right tech now could save you significant dollars in the long run, especially during an economic downturn.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are some additional tips:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Make sure you have your ideal customer profiles (ICPs) nailed down, so you know where to focus your efforts.<\/li>\n\t<li>Based on your ICPs and available data, create specific content experiences that speak to these buyers at this point in their journey with you and with their current needs in mind.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>8. Be Bold in Your Expectations&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>While many leaders suggest scaling down your expectations during times when you&rsquo;re strapped for cash or your resources are restricted, Meagen had a different, powerful view. She said that team members need to remember these are the opportunities they&rsquo;ve wanted, in which they can prove themselves and show what they&rsquo;re capable of. She said economically shaky times are when leaders must challenge their teams, and expect more of them - not less.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>For marketers specifically, Meagen instructed to:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>Show ROI<\/em> and how you&rsquo;re driving pipeline.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li><em>Know attribution<\/em> and how to prove it.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li><em>Make sure you&rsquo;re providing ROI to your customers<\/em>, so they&rsquo;re getting value from your company and are incentivized to stay with you.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>By following this guidance from seasoned, savvy marketing leaders and relying on the right tech, you&rsquo;ll be positioned to guide your team through what&rsquo;s ahead - and keep buyers engaged along the way. Then, when the market is hot again (which you can trust it will be), you&rsquo;ll be stronger than ever and your customers will be ready to buy from you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n"}

From triumphs to tribulations, we&#39;re sharing the whole story.<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a brand new year and a brand new series here at Uberflip.<\/p>\n\n<p>As part of an effort to raise the bar on our marketing, our new team has been implementing features of the Uberflip platform across our programs and sharing the results. Some people call this &quot;eating your own dog food,&quot; but we&#39;re not about to crack open a can of <em>Alpo<\/em>&mdash;let&rsquo;s just call it popping the cork on our own champagne.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>For my first conversation, I sat down with Joanna Zerga, Senior ABM Experience Manager here at Uberflip.<\/p>\n\n<p>As the owner of our account-based marketing programs, Joanna&rsquo;s been <strong>digging deep into the platform&rsquo;s ability to personalize at scale<\/strong>, running A\/B tests to see for herself how effective dynamically personalized content streams perform against static ones.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>I was delighted to have her share the results.<\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>Colin: Hi Joanna. For people who don&rsquo;t know you, what are your roles and responsibilities at Uberflip?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Joanna: <\/strong>I run the ABM program, which means I work very closely with our sales team to create and accelerate opportunities in our target account lists. It includes the whole gamut of marketing campaigns&ndash;both digital and in-person experiences.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: How do you feel about the word &ldquo;smarketing&rdquo;?<\/strong> [Eds. note. At Uberflip, we define <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/uberflip-blog-posts\/smarketing-keeping-it-real-between-sales-and-marketing\">smarketing<\/a> as a &ldquo;symbiotic relationship between sales and marketing.&rdquo;]<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J: <\/strong>Smarketing sounds like <em>shmedium<\/em>. [laughs] It&rsquo;s fun. I believe in smarketing, even if the word is a bit cheesy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve worked at companies where <em>this<\/em> is what marketing does and <em>this<\/em> is what sales does&mdash;and there&rsquo;s a disconnect that results in goals that aren&rsquo;t aligned. It can even create a bit of hostility between teams.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>When marketing is running campaigns but sales isn&rsquo;t aware or engaged, it can feel like marketing for marketing&rsquo;s sake. And the sales team may feel like they don&rsquo;t have support too because the marketing team just doesn&rsquo;t understand their processes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Smarketing is collaboration, and it helps us do our jobs better. I benefit from working closely with the sales team not only to roll out effective campaigns. Open communication also allows marketing to fill in any gaps so the team can be more successful.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: What&#39;s your goal in using Uberflip for account-based marketing?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J: <\/strong>One of the biggest challenges for ABM is being able to engage your target audiences through all the different channels at scale&mdash;digital, physical mailers, events, et cetera. It can be a very painstaking, manual process of outreach. These are not necessarily difficult tasks, but it&rsquo;s very time-consuming to create separate campaigns and messaging that go to very narrow audiences.<\/p>\n\n<p>A key benefit of Uberflip is being able to dynamically personalize campaign destinations and then scale to different audiences&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s 1:1, 1:few, or 1:many. It integrates with different personalizer apps built specifically for Uberflip, like Demandbase or 6sense, and using these tools reduces the time needed to build hyper-personalized marketing streams.<\/p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s effectively a shortcut. It&rsquo;s a tool in your tech stack that allows you to do a level of automation that makes your marketing life easier.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: What did ABM look like before you started using Uberflip?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J: <\/strong>Once upon a time, the Uberflip marketing team ran many fun and creative ABM-focused campaigns.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>I can look at old campaigns, but I don&rsquo;t know the strategy behind them or how they performed. We also changed our ABM solutions platform during a transitional period, and when the new tool was rolled out, it was underutilized.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>So, in many ways, I&rsquo;ve started from scratch.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>We use 6sense for identifying the right accounts and for the personalizer app, so I&#39;m coming in fresh to test how effective it is when building marketing streams for ABM campaigns.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: So essentially, the idea was to test how well dynamic personalization performs?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J: <\/strong>Exactly. You create a static landing page that you send into the universe. A hundred people click on it, and they all see the same thing&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter who they are.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>But by activating the personalization app within an Uberflip marketing stream you send out one URL, but now when a hundred people click on it, each person could have a different experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>This was my hypothesis: When you activate that personalization, you&rsquo;re going to see better engagement and results.<\/p>\n\n<p>When it comes to ABM campaigns, you don&rsquo;t have to manually build multiple 1:1 landing pages in order to create personalized experiences if you have the right tools, content, and tagging in place. This is personalization at scale and it will make running ABM campaigns faster, more efficient, and probably cheaper for you as well.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Screencap of a personalized content stream\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2E2MWJiMjkxOTYzLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTAxYjAwN2YyYmFkMjNiMzkyOGNkMGMxM2NlZTQ5YWEx\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: When you say personalization, what does personalization actually look like for you?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J: <\/strong>There&rsquo;s basic personalization, like tokens to identify your stream visitor by company and incorporate their logo into the banner designs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>But <em>true<\/em> personalization is activated when creating unique experiences through content. I can create marketing streams:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#555555\">that serve up content that is specific to certain personas and industries,<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#555555\">where an account may be in the buying cycle,<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#555555\">or use intent data to provide insight into the keywords they&rsquo;re researching.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Companies may have hundreds or even thousands of pieces of content. As long as the content is tagged and organized, you can select the relevant assets for each person visiting your stream.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: What was the most obvious advantage of using Uberflip?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J: <\/strong>The most obvious advantage is that I can create one marketing stream to engage different audiences. That level of dynamic customization saves me time so that I don&rsquo;t have to build 1:1 streams for each account. It enables me to launch my ABM campaigns faster so I can work on other projects.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Advantage number two is stream analytics. When the campaign is completed, I can look back at the stream performance and better understand the buyer&rsquo;s behavior&mdash;were they engaged, how long did they stay, which assets were relevant, and if there were any repeat visitors.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>This data helps me to better understand the buyer&rsquo;s journey and which assets are resonating with my target audiences.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: Can you walk me through the A\/B testing project in more detail? Where did you begin?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J:<\/strong> To start, you need to identify your audience. For this campaign, the audience was based on our ICP with some additional segmentation (based on 6sense data). Since this was a test campaign, I used a semi-wide net of about 1,200 accounts (1:many type approach).<\/p>\n\n<p>Then, I created two separate but almost identical marketing streams. One stream was static, with no personalization. It had standard messaging, &ldquo;Hey marketer, learn about ABM personalization at scale&rdquo; or something to that effect. And the stream was filled with content around ABM and personalization. Essentially, just like any other landing page out there.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Illustration of static vs dynamic streams for ABM\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2I3MGI3OTA0OWJmLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTBlZGU2NzI1YjdmMWVhYzMzYjljMWMzNzk2YTc4ODMx\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>Then I cloned that stream and enabled all the dynamic personalization features I could. I started with the 6sense personalizer app to identify each stream visitor by their account and show them custom messaging. As soon as they land on my stream page, the first thing they&rsquo;ll see is, &ldquo;Hey XYZ company, here&rsquo;s how we can help you solve this issue you&rsquo;re dealing with.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>The next step was to activate the personalization for the stream assets themselves using tagging. I included assets that were based on industry, like healthcare, manufacturing, software, et cetera. When somebody lands on the stream and the app recognizes that their company was in, say, financial services, it&rsquo;s going to serve up additional assets that are relevant to the financial services industry. It&rsquo;s like creating layers of content.<\/p>\n\n<p>Similarly, I was able to activate certain assets if the personalizer app recognized their tech. For example, if the account is identified as a Hubspot user or a Marketo user, the stream would serve up assets that are relevant to how Uberflip integrates with that software.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Illustration of static vs dynamic streams for ABM as they appear to visitors\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2I3MGI4ODJhMGIyLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWM0YjNlN2E2YWEzMDcwNjBjMjk3NzdiNjA3ZGM1ZDI4\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>So again, this creates a completely dynamic experience depending on who lands on the page. Because they&rsquo;re from different industries or they have a different type of tech stack, they&rsquo;re going to get served up different information that&rsquo;s relevant to them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once the streams were built, I ran A\/B testing via email and 6sense display ads in parallel. It was a randomized 50\/50 split for each email or ad click to land on either the static or personalized stream.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: How long did it take you to get results?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J:<\/strong> This campaign ran for about seven weeks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: And what were the results, if you can share them? How did you measure success?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J:<\/strong> There are two sets of measurements that I reviewed. First, there&rsquo;s the initial channel engagement how many people clicked through the email links and display ads. That&rsquo;s standard for any digital marketing campaign.<\/p>\n\n<p>Specifically for testing personalization, it meant taking a look at the stream analytics in Uberflip. When people landed on either stream A or stream B, do we see more activity&mdash;more clickthroughs, longer duration times, clicking a CTA&mdash;on the static page or on the dynamic one?<\/p>\n\n<p>My hypothesis was that the dynamic page would see more activity. And I could definitely see there was more activity&mdash;as well as return activity&mdash;on the dynamic page compared to the static page. We saw&nbsp;<strong>62% more asset views, in fact, as well as&nbsp;20% more time spent on the page and a&nbsp;25% increase in scroll depth<\/strong>.<img alt=\"Graph showing results discussed above \" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2E2MWI4OTdhZjQ4LnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTI2MGFkMjYzNTAxMmY0Njk0MDM2MTRmZWI4MWNiZmJh\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Engagement results: personalization increases content views and overall session metrics.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: What&rsquo;s next for ABM at Uberflip? What does completing this project make possible for you?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J:<\/strong> Now that I know how easy it is to activate personalization, I&rsquo;ve been helping other folks on the team test it out in their own streams. Ideally, every marketing stream should have some element of personalization turned on&mdash;especially ABM.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, we have a big content library and this project has revealed the need to review our tagging structure for better personalization, as well as some content gaps. We use 6sense and I can create just about any kind of segmentation for my target audiences and turn that into an asset tag (which is a story for another day.) I&rsquo;m also planning some additional testing on engaging ABM audiences with CTAs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: Thanks for your time.

Neither should you risk important, existing revenue streams by focusing solely on prospecting and closing deals. Acquiring new customers is costly, time-consuming, and not especially easy in uncertain times.<\/p>\n\n<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it make perfect sense to keep the customers you already have?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/uberflip-blog-posts\/why-marketers-need-to-think-about-churn\">Preventing customer churn<\/a> takes thoughtful planning.<\/strong> That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to develop a content strategy that educates customers on the use of your product. You can then use it to put your customers on the road to success.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In this article, we&#39;ll introduce you to the three pillars of customer retention and then give you a roadmap for developing a retention-focused content strategy. (You can always <a href=\"#develop\">jump down to that bit<\/a> if you&#39;re itching to put it into practice.)<\/p>\n\n<h2>Three Pillars of Customer Retention<\/h2>\n\n<p>Content is the best way B2B businesses can address the customer retention question. Quality content demonstrates your company&rsquo;s commitment to the customer&rsquo;s success. After all, whatever product or service you&rsquo;re offering, customers will need to learn the ins and outs of it to use it effectively. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>To improve customer retention, Uberflip&rsquo;s customer success team focuses on three pillars:<\/p>\n\n<h3>1. Using real-life examples<\/h3>\n\n<p>There are few better ways to demonstrate the value of a product than to provide real-life examples of it in action.<\/p>\n\n<p>By showing how another company uses our product, for instance, we <strong>enable customers who are considering canceling to see the value of the product directly <\/strong>without having to be &quot;sold&quot; on it. This takes the burden away from the sales call and puts it on the success side.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>It can also serve as inspiration. <\/strong>Seeing what other people are able to accomplish with a product can often spark renewed interest and engagement. For instance, we created&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/ebook\/the-big-book-of-personalized-marketing-examples\">The Big Book of Personalized Marketing Examples<\/a> to&nbsp;showcase many of the ways that customers use our platform to create engaging, relevant content experiences.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2NhZDU4YjY5NGQ5LnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTNmM2ExY2YyM2EyMzMzZTRlMDk5OGE3MjNjNGMzNWU4\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, if your real-life examples come <em>from<\/em> customers, you&#39;re also strengthening <em>those<\/em>&nbsp;relationships. <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/customer-stories\/demand-generation-and-abm-campaign-that-increased-pipeline-by-267\">Customer stories<\/a>&nbsp;can serve a lot of functions, but one really important one is to celebrate the achievements of teams who&#39;ve used your product or service. We&#39;re genuinely impressed by the marketing chops we see on a regular basis, and this content helps us declare our feelings in a public space.<\/p>\n\n<h3>2. Leveraging existing content<\/h3>\n\n<p>Like many companies, we have lots of great content&mdash;white papers, ebooks, webinars, product guides, you name it. A lot of this stuff gets created for prospects, but it can be tremendously helpful when repurposed into content streams for existing customers, especially when paired with new material that puts it into context.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBy showing our customers that we care enough to create educational content and provide video training walkthroughs and personalized consultations, we show that the value they get from working with us not only comes from the product. It&rsquo;s also generated by the people behind the scenes who are determined to see them succeed.<\/p>\n\n<h3>3. Starting the retention process early<\/h3>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve alluded to this above, but there&#39;s a maxim all customer marketers should live by&mdash;heck, it honestly applies to most human relationships:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<blockquote><q>Start the retention process when the customer is still open to staying and not after they have already told you they are leaving.<\/q><\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Always strive to prevent cancellations before they occur. At Uberflip, we hold bi-weekly webinars for training, send email blasts with offers for personalized consultations, and, most of all, we <strong>search for solutions to problems before they arise<\/strong>. Having to connect with support or pour through a technical guide can often be a point of friction&mdash;no matter how good your customer services teams are.<\/p>\n\n<p>These three pillars all have one factor in common, and that&rsquo;s content. Developing retention-focused content is a conscious choice that comes from setting firm goals and objectives to prevent and reduce customer churn. Drive product adoption, educate customers on best practices, and give your team the tools to deliver great customer engagements.<\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n<h2><a id=\"develop\" name=\"develop\">Develop Retention-Focused Content<\/a><\/h2>\n\n<p>Much of today&rsquo;s excellent content marketing is aimed at <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/uberflip-blog-posts\/26-content-offers-and-lead-generation-examples-to-drive-demand\">lead generation<\/a> and conversion. This is unquestionably a primary benefit of strong content, but there&rsquo;s a whole other facet that can drive outstanding results for your top line: customer retention.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Using <strong>your content hub for retention can help create a recurring revenue stream<\/strong>, depending on your business model. It also helps build brand loyalists who contribute to referral sales through their reviews, endorsements, and shared content. Here&#39;s how to get started developing retention-focused content for your customer base.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3>Step 1: Find out what your current customers want to learn<\/h3>\n\n<p>As with all good marketing, your content must say something your customers want to hear, and it should be delivered creatively and uniquely. This makes it vital to approach content marketing for customer retention in the same way you&rsquo;d approach content for lead gen&mdash;by finding out what your customers want. Getting your hands on this information might require the following:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Interviews: <\/strong>Do you have customers you interact with regularly? Interviewing customers one-on-one can give you great insight into what your customers want to know about your product and the market in general.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Surveys: <\/strong>Asking happy customers to perform a quick survey is a tried-and-true tactic in the marketer&rsquo;s playbook. You won&rsquo;t get everyone involved, but you&rsquo;ll get great feedback on what kind of content will perform well.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Focus groups: <\/strong>Get a bunch of customers (or other stakeholders) together in a room. Prompt them to interact around their responsibilities and needs. Take notes.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Independent research: <\/strong>Find forums, social networks, blogs, and other websites where your customers interact with each other or industry thought leaders. Find out what people are (and aren&rsquo;t) talking about.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2NhZDZmYzYwMjE0LnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWQ0ODA0MjgzOTI1YzQwMjM4ZGM0NGRkODc1YzZiNjk5\" \/><\/p>\n\n<figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Running focus groups can be a great way of capturing the voice of your customer.

The best way to approach this is to analyze the different segmentations that make up your market.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are three customer segments you&rsquo;ll need to build strong walls around:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Audience: <\/strong>What content makes the most sense for your potential customers? Which information impacts current customers? Do your customers work in different industries, and if so, are you creating industry-specific content? <strong>Create and organize your audience segments diligently for a firmer grip on effective content distribution.<\/strong><\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Product relevance:<\/strong> Most of your lead gen content is product-agnostic. With current customers, there may be a greater need for product-specific content. Segment your product-specific and product-agnostic content where necessary.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Channel segmentation: <\/strong>Which channels make the most sense for your retention-focused content? For example, you may have a <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.uberflip.com\/h\/\" target=\"_blank\">knowledge base<\/a> and forums that are separate from continued industry learning but equally important for retention. Or you may find customers engage with email content more often than they find your blog posts through LinkedIn.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2NhZDhhOTQ5ZjAyLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTk0MjVkMjcwMGY4ZTVkNzQ0YmE2NjZjOWQ5M2IzMzQy\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h3>Step 3: Get customers to opt-in wherever possible<\/h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes, you need to prompt customers to opt-in for continued learning or risk alienating them.&nbsp;<strong>Forcing content on your customers can have the opposite effect if you end up annoying rather than helping<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>This could be as simple as asking your customer to check a box &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; for periodic emails while they&rsquo;re in the process of buying from you. Consent is already built into your social channels, of course, because customers choose whether or not to follow you.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Step 4: Gather feedback to measure consumption and retention<\/h3>\n\n<p>Do you think you can simply create content, publish it, and move on to the next thing? Think again! You need to measure whether or not your retention content pushes the correct customer buttons. For this purpose, you&rsquo;ll want to look at surface metrics around consumption.<\/p>\n\n<p>These might include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Social sharing statistics<\/li>\n\t<li>Whether visitors are bouncing or perusing other pieces of content<\/li>\n\t<li>Opt-ins and opt-outs<\/li>\n\t<li>Evaluating channels by finding out how visitors are finding articles<\/li>\n\t<li>How often individual visitors return to content pages<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll also want to dig deeper to determine whether your content is impacting retention and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rollworks.com\/resources\/blog\/retain-customers-and-maximize-roi\" target=\"_blank\">benefiting your ROI<\/a>. These measurements might include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Who is consuming the content&mdash;non-customers or customers?<\/li>\n\t<li>Getting qualitative feedback from customers through surveys and direct channels<\/li>\n\t<li>Discovering whether customers interact in comments sections and forums<\/li>\n\t<li>Tracking the entire customer journey from initial purchase through content consumption<\/li>\n\t<li>Final purchase or end of the subscription<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Pro Tip: Appoint a Customer Success Team<\/h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/uberflip-blog-posts\/why-marketers-need-to-think-about-churn\">Customer retention<\/a> has long been a critical issue for businesses. Many companies have found that whether they are small, medium, or large operations, a customer success team can solve this problem. But how does customer success differ from customer service, and what does it have to do with content?<\/p>\n\n<p>The goal of customer success is not simply to answer a customer&rsquo;s question and be done with it.

I think any readers who are also customers may recognize you, but please tell us a little about yourself and your responsibilities.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A: <\/strong>I&rsquo;m Andrea Lodigiani, and I run customer marketing here at Uberflip. I&rsquo;m responsible for enabling and engaging our customer base to improve retention and expansion.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: What&rsquo;s your goal in using Uberflip for customer marketing?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> My team and I use Uberflip on a daily basis. Our mission in customer marketing is to ensure customers are getting the most value out of Uberflip. We do that by enabling them to use it effectively and efficiently based on their company goals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Luckily, customer engagement is one of Uberflip&rsquo;s core use cases, so we have plenty of opportunities to use the platform to accomplish this!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: The Customer L.U.V. program is one example of you using Uberflip, right?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> Yes! The Customer L.U.V. Program is essentially our ambassador program. We use an Uberflip marketing stream to keep our ambassadors up to date on current opportunities, such as speaking at events or getting rewarded for completing certain actions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Each month I also email our ambassadors a breakdown of what&rsquo;s new in the program and include a link to the updated stream that acts as our program clubhouse, if you will.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2UzZTgxNTIyYmFhLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWZhMjY0NGU4OWFlOTEzY2EyZWY4YTNlZWRjM2Y2NjVm\" style=\"height:506px; width:500px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: The &quot;L.U.V.&quot; in Customer L.U.V. refers to one of our values: Listen, Understand, Value. And speaking of understanding, I suppose using the platform helps you better understand the customer&rsquo;s perspective too?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> Exactly.<\/p>\n\n<p>Just like our CSMs, I think of myself as an internal advocate for our customers. By living the customer experience, not only can I better enable customers on how to use the product to achieve their desired outcomes. I can also help create product and documentation improvements our customers would benefit from.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Uberflip core value: LUV\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2NmMjQ2YTJmZTA5LmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWM0MDM5OTllN2NjMTM2Zjc0MjkwZGFkMzMyNmMzZGZl\" style=\"height:463px; width:300px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: What was in place prior to using Uberflip to relaunch Customer L.U.V.?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> Streams were always used to serve up content and information to our ambassadors, but what we&rsquo;ve done to improve the process is really lean on how easy it is to update streams on a regular basis with the most up-to-date info.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>We also used the CTAs across our streams&mdash;so when someone opts into something, such as providing a customer testimonial, we can integrate the form submission into Marketo. That then automatically triggers an email to the ambassador focused on how to record and submit the testimonial.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Integrating Uberflip with Marketo and Salesforce has saved my small team a ton of time on admin work and ensures we&rsquo;re engaging our ambassadors as soon as they show interest.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: Oh, cool. So kind of a self-serve model?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> Yeah, exactly. We want there to be sort of like an on-demand resource center for them, and Uberflip was perfect for setting that up quickly.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: I know it&rsquo;s early, but how close are you to realizing your ambitions for Customer L.U.V.?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A: <\/strong>We&rsquo;ve definitely seen spikes in online reviews. I&#39;ve been really successful in getting product feedback, and any surveying of our ambassadors has been very easy. We also use it for finding event speakers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Uberflip has helped me achieve these goals by making it simple to create a customer-facing portal I can update with a few clicks&mdash;without involving any other teams or engineering resources. It also allows me to see engagement metrics, or what&rsquo;s landing and what&rsquo;s not, so we can learn and make adjustments.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: So the ease of getting started was the most obvious advantage Uberflip provides?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> Well, this is very specific to what I do&hellip; but it&#39;s like killing two birds with one stone, right?&nbsp;<br \/>\nI&#39;m demoing the product while also using it doing my job&mdash;which means I&#39;m able to show our customers how to use our product for their own customer marketing programs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>What I love about my little corner of the product is that I get to showcase how to use Uberflip for customer engagement. It&rsquo;s not the first use case many people think to implement, but it&rsquo;s so simple to get up and running. It&rsquo;s really powerful.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: Can you walk me through, soup to nuts, on how you use Uberflip for events?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> Going into any event, we always make sure to create an event-specific stream. We create sections within each stream for the various types of content we want to make sure our customers see.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2UzZTgzZDgxMGZkLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTJmNzc0OTBlNjg1OTQxYmZlOGNiZWJkMWY3NmI2NWI0\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>So, for example, we&#39;ll have a section for the event recording, the deck, and any takeaway content that we created specifically for that event.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Maybe it&#39;s like a checklist or a one-pager on whatever the specific topic was&mdash;people don&rsquo;t always watch recordings, so having something else for them to absorb makes sense. I&#39;ll also have a section with other relevant Uberflip content that they can use to expand their understanding of the topic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Then we take the link to that stream and that is what we share out. Instead of just linking to a recording, we&#39;ll share the link to the stream in our email follow-up. Using Uberflip Analytics, we can see what people are engaging with&mdash;which helps us optimize for future events and campaigns&mdash;and provide them with added value at the same time.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: What about for Customer L.U.V. program? I imagine that&rsquo;s more complicated.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> It&rsquo;s very similar, actually. Same principles on a bigger scale.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>We created a stream that has different sections based on the different types of opportunities: either opportunities that are time-sensitive or evergreen ones that they can take advantage of when they get time.<\/p>\n\n<p>We tend to use Uberflip Link CTAs to take ambassadors to surveys or websites we want them to visit&mdash;for example, G2 or TrustRadius to leave a review&mdash;and Form CTAs to opt into unique opportunities, like speaking at events or recording a customer story.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2UzZTg0ZTJhNTkzLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTNmNTIwMmVkZDJiOTM3N2M5NzA4M2MyM2VjNzliNGRh\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>This is all automated, actually, when our Salesforce record is updated to active. It lets us know when a contact enrolls and if they are an active ambassador. Then they&rsquo;ll receive an email from Marketo that has a link to the homepage where we advertise the latest about the program.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: Besides Marketo, what other tools are you using with Uberflip?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> We use a lot of Pendo for in-app messaging.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say, for example, going back to an event stream, we want to include a CTA to log in and take a tour of this new feature. So for Sales Assist, for example, we would have a webinar and include relevant resources so that they can self-educate, but we might also have a CTA that says, &ldquo;Take a Tour of Sales Assist&rdquo; to have them engage with the feature.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2UzZTg2NjIzY2FhLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWM2NjA4YTdhYTlhM2Q0Mjk3NDZiNDE0OGEyMjUwZDE4\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>They click on it, it takes them into the application, and it launches Pendo, which would then walk them through the feature&rsquo;s key functions and hopefully drive the desired actions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>We also use MixMax for email productivity on my team. It makes emailing a group of customers at the same time easy while not sacrificing personalization.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: &nbsp;Sounds like you&rsquo;re firing on all cylinders. What&rsquo;s the current status of these projects?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> All three are alive and well.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>I would say the Customer L.U.V. Program was the only one that really required a lot of planning in advance. It took about a month and a half, but that was to relaunch an entire ambassador program, not necessarily just the Uberflip stream that&#39;s associated with it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>We already had the foundational elements. So we revamped it, did some outreach, made sure we had some CTAs to offer off the bat, and then we launched.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: How many ambassadors do we have anyway?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> I think we have about 120. We get a pretty steady flow. So I&#39;m pretty happy with that engagement level. New ambassadors per month is a good metric for us.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>My next focus is on getting our ambassadors to do more. I wanted to get it up and running first. Now I have to actually start managing it on a monthly basis. [laughs]<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: And beyond Customer L.U.V., what&#39;s next?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> Creating streams based on the customer life cycle stages.<\/p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ll create an onboarding stream, a platform utilization, or optimization stream, and then a renewal stream or an upsell stream. The result is that as customers move through the customer life cycle, they have a stream that contains relevant information based on that customer life cycle.<\/p>\n\n<p>Conversely, we&#39;re also talking about how to get the CSMs to create streams for every account so that they can upload call recordings, and they can add relevant information there as well as everything that goes into that.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>So I would say, we&rsquo;re optimizing how we&#39;re using Uberflip for customer engagement and account management based on the customer life cycle and if it&#39;s a managed account or not.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: Wow, I look forward to seeing those streams in action. Thanks for sharing, Andrea.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> You&rsquo;re welcome.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/solutions\/customer-engagement\/\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Call to action to see how Uberflip can elevate your customer retention efforts\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82M2NhY2NlMzkwYjE1LnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTY3ZjdiZDEzMzRjY2RiMjUyNmZiNTAyZjI3ZGRmOTVm\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n"}

Together we redefined their tagging structure and strategy - a vital process for any marketing team looking to improve their content activation and consumption.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>However, 400+ streams are a lot to update manually so Trimble used Uberflip&#39;s Bulk Task Smasher to not only update their library of streams but also add tags to thousands of items in their hub with the click of a button.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Trimble has also sped up their content activation by replacing spreadsheets with Uberflip&#39;s Enhanced Tag Manager. This allows them to not only implement a standard tag and tag group strategy, but tag items quickly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Trimble&#39;s tagging pro tip!<\/strong><\/em> Reduce the number of tag groups and consider language barriers when tagging content that will be used across different markets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"color: #ce0058;\">Shifting scopes and process improvements<\/h2>\n\n<p>Starting in January, 2021, Trimble shifted their content to Uberflip and made sweeping improvements to global processes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>They first decided to go all-in with Uberflip, rather than just using it for a few markets or strategies. By doing so, they have been able to maintain stronger alignment and continuously improve processes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The impact this has had on their marketing KPIs are obvious - they are attracting larger target groups to their Hubs as well as seeing an increased number of sessions once people hit their pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"color: #ce0058;\">Driving organic search traffic with streams<\/h2>\n\n<p>By making big scale decisions on how to handle stream-level settings, Trimble steered more traffic in the right direction and overall increased their organic search traffic from 2,900 sessions in 2021 to 9,238 sessions in 2022.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"color: #ce0058;\">Integrating with Marketo to drive lead generation<\/h2>\n\n<p>Instead of using Marketo CTAs, Trimble opted to use Uberflip CTAs within streams because they are specifically designed to provide a seamless user experience for their readers.

From triumphs to tribulations, we&#39;re sharing the whole story.<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Very little great marketing gets done in a silo. Even small-time tactics require a team effort to build something that delivers results. And when people in different functions work together informed by broader strategy, that&rsquo;s when the magic happens.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In this week&rsquo;s The Flipside, we&rsquo;re showcasing one such superhero team here at Uberflip: a data-driven experiment by marketers that may result in additional functionality for customers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>I sat down with all three Uberflippers to discuss their efforts to integrate Uberflip CTAs into our website as effectively as possible: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jeffkew\/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Kew<\/a>, a seasoned veteran of marketing ops space; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/kovalandriy\/\" target=\"_blank\">Andriy Koval<\/a>, our front-end web developer; and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/waqas-khan-digital\/\" target=\"_blank\">Waqas Khan<\/a>, a demand gen marketer working to refine our paid ad strategy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Our discussion revealed the importance of adopting a collaborative, experimental mindset whenever you&rsquo;re innovating&mdash;and why you sometimes need to hack together an imperfect solution before you can find a clear path forward.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>Colin: Hi everyone. Before we jump into the CTA project, why don&rsquo;t you each speak to your roles here at Uberflip? Jeff, why don&rsquo;t we start with you?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Jeff: <\/strong>Thanks Colin, my role is the Director of Marketing Operations. I manage the technology platforms we use to support our go-to-market efforts.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Andriy:<\/strong> I&rsquo;m Andriy Koval, a web developer on the marketing team here at Uberflip, working closely with Jeff on integrating all our tech into our platforms.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Waqas:<\/strong> My role is Demand Generation Specialist. I&#39;m responsible for running campaigns&mdash;right now, specifically for demo requests, increasing engagement and awareness. I&#39;m also trying to understand different segments&mdash;like MQLs and SQLs&mdash;and how to move these segments through the funnel.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: Jeff, can you give me a quick overview&mdash;an elevator pitch&mdash;for this project?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J: <\/strong>Sure. We wanted to better leverage Uberflip CTAs in the form conversion process.<\/p>\n\n<p>Essentially, changing the flow of capturing form data using a Marketo form to capturing the data using our native Uberflip forms. This allows us to instantly track the converted visitor across our hub and personalize their experience faster, while also pushing all of the data to Marketo using our native integration.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: Interesting. So what inspired you to go down this road?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A: <\/strong>This started in a conversation between Jeff and me about how we use forms on our website.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Historically, we&#39;ve been using Marketo in a few ways. We embed Marketo forms throughout our website, for instance, and we used it as a native integration with Marketo on our Uberflip hub.&nbsp;<br \/>\nBut we noticed, though, that that setup could work more efficiently for personalization.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J: <\/strong>Marketo forms on a Marketo landing page work extremely well. Marketo is a very robust platform, and the forms are very robust too. But we knew there was more we could achieve by combining Uberflip CTAs with Marketo than we weren&rsquo;t getting by using Marketo forms on their own.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Previously, when visitors filled out a Marketo form, we would have to wait until someone later filled out an Uberflip CTA associated with a stream or item before we could build a more detailed tracking history, including first touch, last touch, and UTM data pushed into Uberflip Analytics.<\/p>\n\n<p>If they filled out an Uberflip CTA first, though, the data flows into Marketo automatically through the native integration.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82NDE5ZGQ1NmRiMWFjLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWViYzVlNzJkZGYwZTEzOGIyNTY5ZmNhYmNlZWE4OTI0\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: And that&rsquo;s where you started?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J: <\/strong>The ability to add an Uberflip CTA to a page on your website was developed, but needed some tweaking to capture the kind of attribution that we use. It wasn&#39;t a priority yet on the product roadmap. For me, it was like, well, why not? From a marketing ops perspective, this makes the most sense for us and our customers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, Andriy, owning web ops, has that dev experience and could build and test it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A: <\/strong>Yeah, that&rsquo;s how things started. I was, like, yeah, okay let me give it a try. I&rsquo;ll try to <em>iframe<\/em> it. I&rsquo;ll try this, I&rsquo;ll try that. We tried a few different things actually. Really experimenting to understand how we can solve this problem for Jeff.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>C: Waqas, I know you&rsquo;ve been a contributor to this project too but you have a slightly different objective in mind. Do you want to give us your perspective?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>W:<\/strong> At the start, my separate goal was to test the performance of using Uberflip items as landing pages compared to our WordPress landing pages on the website, to find out which are better optimized for conversion rates in different contexts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>We ran a few tests running ads promoting a downloadable ebook, though, and we were seeing a much higher bounce rate sending people directly to an Uberflip item compared to a WordPress landing page.&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82NDFiNmU4MzQxMjJiLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTNkMTFiMjA4YmI3ZTk4YzQyNDY1YjM3MmRiMzE4MGVh\" \/><strong>J:<\/strong> Interestingly enough, before our time at Uberflip, there was a study done to show that if a visitor went to a hub item&mdash;they landed on a stream, they clicked on an item&mdash;the conversion, once they were in, was higher than a traditional landing page or squeeze page. The study showed that people converted <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/uberflip-ebooks\/content-experience-report\" target=\"_blank\">17% higher on an overlaid CTA<\/a> compared to a landing page.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>But when Waqas repeated the test, we saw the opposite results. That makes sense&mdash;it&rsquo;s a different world, audiences are different, behaviors change, and the market changes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>W: <\/strong>So really, my involvement started with me trying to make a data-informed decision on which approach to use for our demand campaigns: a squeeze page or an Uberflip stream.<\/p>\n\n<p>I knew if we can embed an Uberflip CTA on a WordPress squeeze page, we could also take advantage of the benefits specific to Uberflip that Jeff&rsquo;s already mentioned&mdash;while still being able to visually optimize it for conversions as our WordPress page layout does.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Retargeting for demand audiences and running ABM campaigns are also way easier with Uberflip. And with the 6sense integration, we can find out which companies are engaging with us. Then we can better work with the sales team and give them data to go after these accounts that are showing strong signals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>So I was excited by the work they were doing.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: Andriy mentioned earlier that we were experimenting to find a solution. How&rsquo;d that go?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J: <\/strong>Using an Uberflip CTA was the key, but that takes us to the technical problem we faced.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>With a Marketo form, you can generate an embed script and drop it into the page at a specific location and it generates a form for you. It&rsquo;s a very tight integration.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>But using an Uberflip CTA didn&rsquo;t do that out of the box. It only offered the ability to iframe the form on that landing page, which is sometimes not ideal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: Why not, Andriy?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A: <\/strong>There are pros and cons, obviously. I like to use the analogy of a house. An embedded form actually lives on your website, it&rsquo;s in the house or your living room. So, any attribution you&rsquo;ve added to the page is instantly associated with that form from your house.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>But an iframe is like looking through the window at the house across a street, and the problem becomes, how do you get that information into your house?<\/p>\n\n<p>An iframe implementation works in some use cases, and it&rsquo;s faster to set up. In many instances, though, it can be harder to customize it&mdash;and it might be slightly harder for customers to use effectively. And we were worried that with how Jeff wanted to use it with Marketo, it might not work correctly.<\/p>\n\n<p>But <em>iframing<\/em> was a step in the right direction to give it a try and see how this performs.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82NDEzNDg5OWMyYzVmLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWZmMGU3NDk3YTRlMjAxMmFhODIyNWRiMjVlZTk4ODNk\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: I understand the current implementation is an evolution of that first version.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J: <\/strong>The first version that Andriy implemented was very much a proof of concept to show that we can push information through an Uberflip CTA from the website to the hub. But it wasn&#39;t something that was going to be scalable in the sense that our customers couldn&rsquo;t apply it because it still required a lot of customization from Andriy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>A: <\/strong>Yeah, so we had help from Yoav in taking it to the next step. [eds. note, <em>Yoav Schwartz is Uberflip Co-Founder<\/em>]. He had more access and knowledge of how the Uberflip hub works. So he was able to review when Andriy developed and build a better implementation, the one that we&#39;re testing right now.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J: <\/strong>In a way, what Yoav went and did&mdash;Andriy, made that possible. Yoav was able to see a lot of that work that Andriy had already done and packaged it into a piece of code that could easily be added as literally a toggle switch on or off in the Uberflip frontend.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now the customer can actually go and take that script, and just drop it into their WordPress page. At this current stage, all you need to do is quickly edit the script and change the CTA ID, but otherwise, it&rsquo;s plug-and-play.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>But Andriy, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve talked to you yet, but is there a way to build a module on that WordPress page where the marketer can just drop it in?<\/p>\n\n<p><em>At this point in the interview, Jeff and Andriy began to discuss adding additional functionality to make Uberflip CTAs even easier to use with Uberflip. I&rsquo;ve omitted the details, but it&rsquo;s really obvious that when you get people like Jeff, Andriy, and Waqas together, they&rsquo;re incredibly enthusiastic about experimenting to solve a problem.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: We&#39;ve called this project an experiment. Is it still in the experimental phase? Are we still seeing how it works against a traditional setup? Or are we all in on this?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J: <\/strong>We are. Waqas is running experiments right now. I set up the Marketo program for him to capture those leads on that landing page he created based on this new, more customer-friendly solution.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>W: <\/strong>Right now, we&rsquo;re running a lot of segmented campaigns that point to the WordPress page with a Marketo form. But also we&rsquo;re testing an ad group that uses an iframed solution, sending people to a landing page that has an Uberflip CTA on it. So our goal is to run this campaign now and see if it&#39;s impacting conversion rates or if the conversion rates are generally the same. If it works, we can implement this solution across all our campaigns.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once that&#39;s done, we&rsquo;re going to run further tests to understand more about what converts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>What I want to do is run a campaign where we will promote a downloadable item, like an ebook. The test is going to be comparing a WordPress page with an Uberflip CTA versus sending them to an Uberflip item directly, with a show-beside or a pop-up CTA. And that way, we&#39;ll be able to understand how these perform&mdash;and that is going to be the real test.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: What are the initial results looking like? Any learnings you&rsquo;d like to share?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>J: <\/strong>It&rsquo;s still a work in progress. We&#39;ve improved our tracking on the Uberflip hub side and maintained tracking on the Marketo side. As we expand our use of the hub CTA across all conversion pages, we&#39;ll approach 100% tracking of all conversions in Uberflip Analytics.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>As of today, we have an Uberflip analytics report showing us the CTA conversions since <strong>January that are converting as high as 33%.<\/strong> Plus, we can now identify each use of the global CTA we have for demo requests.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>W:&nbsp;<\/strong>It&#39;s going to make sharing our results in a future installment of The Flipside so much easier, that&#39;s for sure.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82NDFiNmQ1ZjhjNDlmLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWFhNmYyZWFjZTIxNDc5MDBkZjNiMTUxMDQ3Yjg4MmQy\" style=\"height:470px; width:750px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Improved tracking in action lets us see all conversions in Uberflip Analytics.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: I can&#39;t wait, Waqas. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>There&rsquo;s an amazing story here.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The three of you started by trying to solve some challenges you were facing and better understand our prospects&#39; behavior.

From triumphs to tribulations, we&#39;re here to share the whole story, including best practices you can apply toward your own marketing efforts.<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Picture an industry conference hall buzzing with activity. You&#39;re standing at a booth, eager to chat with peers and prospects about all your company has to offer. But <em>:::record scratch:::<\/em> there&#39;s so much to see and do, it&#39;s hard to connect with anyone for more than a few brief moments before they get pulled in another direction.<\/p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve all been there, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/mojomogul\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Hoehn<\/a>, Uberflip&#39;s VP of Marketing. With so much happening at Uberflip, a 30-second elevator pitch barely skims the surface of what Uberflip has to offer. So he approached <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/rhandijenkins\/\" target=\"_blank\">Rhandi Jenkins<\/a>, Senior Implementation Specialist at Uberflip, with an idea: to create a self-guided demo that quickly shows off personalization and how it works.<\/p>\n\n<p>We sat down to learn more about their collaboration, how they leveraged their new Uberflip demo at a recent conference, and what you can learn from their experience.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s what they had to say.<\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n<p><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Colin: Will you kick us off by explaining your roles at Uberflip?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rhandi: <\/strong>I am a Senior Implementation Specialist at Uberflip. It&#39;s been a really fun experience learning about marketing, getting to know how marketers think, and how our tool helps marketers in their day-to-day jobs.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ben: <\/strong>I&#39;m the VP of Marketing at Uberflip. I&#39;m responsible for the team that runs marketing here.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: What was in place prior to the self-serve demo you created?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>B: <\/strong>In this case, we didn&#39;t have anything concrete. Having attended a handful of trade shows in my first year at Uberflip, I realized that people will often come to the booth and ask, &ldquo;What does Uberflip do?&rdquo; But it&#39;s difficult to explain the platform and its benefits in those very brief conversations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>So, we decided to show the power of Uberflip in 30 seconds on the device in their hand&mdash;they could take it home, they could share it with their team, they could do whatever they wanted with it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: Can you give us a big picture of what your goals were in creating this demo?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>R: <\/strong>This sales demo allows Ben to connect with prospects, encourage them to engage with our content, and understand how our tool works. It not only showed how we use our tools but also demonstrated how these tools can help in their prospecting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>B: <\/strong>We try to use Uberflip the way that our customers do, which includes programs, events, ABM, demand, customer engagement&hellip; basically everywhere that we can leverage an Uberflip stream, we do. And not only that, we try to push the bounds of the functionality, so we&#39;re turning out best practices and playbooks for our customers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: How is Uberflip helping you achieve your objectives?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>B:<\/strong> This helps us showcase a couple of things Uberflip does really well, like personalization.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>If customers or marketers are running any kind of ABM programs at scale, they&#39;ll need personalization to rotate through thousands of accounts in one vertical or hundreds of buyer personas in one account. To do that effectively, the right piece of content and the right messaging needs to be in front of the right person at the right time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Another feature is what we call&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/help.uberflip.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360038009851-Query-String-Personalizer-User-Guide\" target=\"_blank\">query string personalization<\/a>&mdash;you can literally put in a UTM parameter and the URL and then dynamically customize content based on that. It&#39;s super simple and powerful.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82MTI4ZWViYWExNmM5LnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTZlYzdhOGQwOGFkZDMyMjgyOTAxNjJiYjYzMGRhYjAy\" style=\"height:450px; width:800px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>In addition to swapping in logos and more relevant content, Uberflip&#39;s personalization lets you swap in messaging based on URL parameters.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>C: What was the most obvious advantage you feel using Uberflip provides?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>R: <\/strong>For this self-guided demo, we showed how users can get the right content at the right time to the right people. Having the ability to use an internal feature like the query string and not having to purchase external tools is a no-brainer. It&#39;s right in the app for you. You just download it and you&#39;re set to go.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C:<\/strong> Can you walk me through the project? Where did you begin? What features are you using? What tools outside of the platform are you using?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>B:<\/strong> As I mentioned, we needed a self-service demo in hand so if someone asks what Uberflip does, we can easily send them a QR code and walk them through it. We wanted to showcase personalization in a very simple, low-tech way that we could deploy quickly and then revise as we get more advanced with this. We chose sports as our topic since almost everyone likes some kind of sport and the differences between sports are fairly easy to understand.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>From there, Rhandi imported an RSS feed, populated a stream, and asked for someone to choose their favorite sport. We used that to dynamically filter the content that you see, then you can run it again and see how quickly you can personalize it on your mobile device.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82NDJlZjVjZWM0NGE3LnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTI4YzE3MTIxNzRmNzQ0MmQ3Mzk3OGEwNTQ3YTgwMjY4\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: <\/strong>What was the most challenging part of the project? Is there anything you wish you knew before you got started?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>R:<\/strong> It was a tight timeline to get it all turned around. We wanted to make sure we had the testing done right and that we had the right content. It turned out really well and we received some helpful feedback for our next version, so I&#39;m excited to see how V2 goes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>B:<\/strong> Agreed. The challenging part for us was communicating to the rest of the team that we were working on this, and trying to move fast and get this tested and built out because everything was leading up to the main event. Literally.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: How are you measuring success?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>B: <\/strong>Since this was used at an event, we wanted to see how many people would go to our demo.<\/p>\n\n<p>We called it a <em>Ring Pop demo<\/em> because we were handing out these little Ring Pops with a QR code in the candy wrapper. When you scanned the code, you went right to the demo. From there you could fill it out and then you could fill it out a second time to see the personalization, in which case you became eligible for a gift (which was an average of a hundred dollars).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>We had about 20 people that went through and submitted, then about five people that actually went all the way through. There were about 900 people at this event and we scanned almost 200 of them, getting to 20. Not too bad, about 1%, but now we have a baseline so we can increase from there. I&#39;m very excited about the next version.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82NDJkZTE1YmUyNzg0LnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTVjMjgyMDlkZTExMDM2YzgyMzMwOTZjZTFhYjgzYjQ0\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: What&#39;s the current status of this project? How long did it take you?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>B:<\/strong> We want to do a postmortem and talk about V2 and where we think we can take it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our next event is Forrester, which is typically VPs and above. They&#39;re often super technical, so we can go deeper on personalization and they&#39;ll get it right away. We&#39;ll also swap out the sports theme for something we think will resonate with them.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>C: What&#39;s next for your project? What does completing this project make possible for future projects?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>R:<\/strong> My team already decided we&#39;re going to steal this as part of our playbook for customers!&nbsp;<br \/>\nIt&#39;s something we can present to our customers as something they can personalize and do at events too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>B: <\/strong>A more complex version of this with a little more personalization. I still want to use the query string, which is a powerful feature a lot of people don&#39;t know about. We&#39;d like to push the bounds a bit more, see what we can lengthen, see how many questions we can get in there, and then broaden it for a bigger audience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The end goal is to have this as an evergreen leave-behind self-service demo. What I envision is any person can hand out a business card with a QR code on it and say, <em>do you want to know what Uberflip is? Test it yourself, pull out your mobile device, and scan this QR code&hellip;<\/em> and then be able to walk you through everything.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Our other goal is to showcase our cross-department synergy. As often as we can do stuff like this to show what happens when we all work together&mdash;it&#39;s a big win.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/features\/personalization\/\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82Mzg3ZTIwZjU3Mzk2LnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTNhMjBjZTBmYzU2MWMxZmJkOGJmZjZjMDhmOTA3MDVk\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n"}

This process revealed an uneven content distribution, overemphasizing certain pain points and neglecting others. It also exposed a content gap in the consideration stage despite a surplus at the awareness stage.<\/p><p>Using Uberflip&#39;s Enhanced Tag Manager, Foundant established a tagging system for efficient content management and future growth. Custom reports were developed to track content journeys, enabling them to discern high-performing paths and understand their success factors. Best of all, this data-driven approach equipped Foundant with vital insights, guiding them towards more targeted decisions for future content creation.<\/p><\/div><\/div>"}

Once internal champions are engaged, your teams equip them with the tools they need to influence decision-makers (and get that sale).<\/p>\n\n<p>The benefits of ABM are numerous, and if you&rsquo;re not using it, you&rsquo;re likely missing out. Let&rsquo;s dig into why B2B businesses need ABM and the five ABM benefits you can&rsquo;t go without.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Why ABM works for B2B<\/h2>\n\n<p>B2B businesses are uniquely suited to take advantage of account-based marketing. First, you probably manage longer sales cycles with multiple stakeholders. Those deals tend to be larger and the relationships longer term. As a result, the decision-makers involved are interested in taking the time to learn about your offering and how a vendor relationship with you will benefit them over your competition.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The time and effort involved in these deals make a highly customized ABM experience worth the investment. ABM is specific and personalized to each deal and customer&mdash;making each interaction feel intentional and bespoke. You will likely maintain an ongoing relationship with your customers and ABM allows you to start that relationship off on strong footing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"the benefits of account based marketing apply to some b2b more than others\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82NDkyNDEwMzc5MDIzLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTMxYmZiMWE2NDU2NjZjYTU1ZTM2MzlkMjgyNjk4NjEw\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h2>5 Benefits of ABM<\/h2>\n\n<h3>Improved marketing and sales alignment<\/h3>\n\n<p>Work silos can happen to anyone&mdash;but your revenue depends on marketing and sales being able to work together effectively. That&rsquo;s where ABM can help. Sixty-six percent of teams say ABM is <a href=\"https:\/\/abmleadershipalliance.com\/ebook\/elevating-abm-2022-benchmark-study\/\" target=\"_blank\">significantly improving<\/a> marketing and sales alignment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>ABM also helps marketing build goodwill with sales by directly supporting the goals they care about most&mdash;namely pipeline, speed, and revenue booked. After implementing ABM, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/digital-markets\/insights\/abm-strategy\" target=\"_blank\">sales teams experienced<\/a> higher win rates, faster sales cycles, and increased deal sizes. And 84% of teams have seen <a href=\"https:\/\/abmleadershipalliance.com\/ebook\/elevating-abm-2022-benchmark-study\/\" target=\"_blank\">pipeline growth<\/a> since launching their ABM programs. As a collaborative effort from both go-to-market teams, ABM helps you achieve the same goals.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Looking to run account-based marketing (ABM) for your business but don&#39;t know where to start?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Download this comprehensive <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/templates\/account-based-marketing-template\" target=\"_blank\">account-based marketing template<\/a> designed to help you plan and execute a successful ABM strategy from building customer profiles to activating hyper-relevant content to optimizing your existing campaigns.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<h3>Better conversions and engagement&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n<p>It should come as no surprise that personalized marketing is effective. <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2015\/03\/making-the-consensus-sale\" target=\"_blank\">Research<\/a> published by the Harvard Business Review shows that individual customer stakeholders who perceived supplier content to be tailored to their needs were 40% more willing to buy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Moreover,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/digital-markets\/insights\/abm-strategy\" target=\"_blank\">Gartner<\/a> shows that after implementing ABM, marketing teams experienced improved conversion rates throughout the funnel, increased web traffic, and better advertising and email performance. ABM is proven to drive conversion and engagement&mdash;<a href=\"https:\/\/abmleadershipalliance.com\/ebook\/elevating-abm-2022-benchmark-study\/\" target=\"_blank\">90% of teams<\/a> experience active engagement with their selected accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3>More ROI from ABM efforts<\/h3>\n\n<p>Even though ABM may take more initial time and effort, it&#39;s also more likely to deliver a return on your investment. <a href=\"https:\/\/abmleadershipalliance.com\/ebook\/elevating-abm-2022-benchmark-study\/\" target=\"_blank\">Seventy-two percent<\/a> of teams say ABM delivers higher ROI than other types of marketing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s also easier to prove ABM ROI. By combining leading marketing indicators like ad clicks and form fills, with key sales metrics like deal velocity and win\/loss rates, you get a fuller picture of how well your ABM efforts are going. And since this strategy drives sales and marketing towards the same goals, you&rsquo;re able to more quickly understand whether your efforts are yielding the desired results.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3>Make limited resources go further<\/h3>\n\n<p>In the world of B2B SaaS, pretty much every marketer is having to do more with less. Almost half (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/capabilities\/growth-marketing-and-sales\/our-insights\/marketings-moment-is-now-the-c-suite-partnership-to-deliver-on-growth\" target=\"_blank\">40%<\/a>) of CEOs don&rsquo;t believe marketing investments should be protected in a downturn. So, how can ABM help?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>ABM can be beneficial if you have limited resources&mdash;focusing your sales and marketing efforts towards specific, high-value leads allows you to concentrate on the accounts that are most likely to convert. And since it&rsquo;s easier to prove the ROI of ABM, it&rsquo;s easier to justify the importance of keeping those revenue-generating efforts moving during an unstable quarter. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82NDkyM2RmMTlmMWZlLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTY5ZWM2Y2IwMmIyMzQ4MTFiMWVhZmNkY2U1NzlmNzRi\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/de\/@austindistel?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Austin Distel<\/a> on <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/Imc-IoZDMXc?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash<\/a><\/p>\n\n<h3>Get more value out of your content&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n<p>Creating new content all the time and spreading it widely is expensive and time-consuming (not to mention, questionably effective). Instead, ABM provides a strategic way to create, remix, and repurpose content. The opportunities for reuse are vast&mdash;personalized emails, tailored content streams, and choose-your-own-adventure content experiences are just the beginning.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many B2B businesses choose to personalize existing assets and repurpose content in new ways for new accounts instead of creating net-new content. The best part of this approach is that it saves both budget and time since you&rsquo;re getting the most out of the collateral you already have.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<hr \/>\n<h2>Take advantage of all the ABM benefits with Uberflip<\/h2>\n\n<p>ABM has withstood the ebbs and flows of other trends because it&rsquo;s just smart marketing.

Remember the days when handshakes, in-person meetings, and on-site product demos were the norm? Well, the post-COVID world has shaken things up a lot. Now, we&#39;re navigating a landscape where remote work is common and traditional sales methods are evolving. The digital sales room (DSR) is rapidly becoming crucial to modern sales strategies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s what a DSR is and why it matters to the sales process:<\/p>\n\n<h3>What is a DSR?<\/h3>\n\n<p>A DSR, or Digital Sales Room, is a virtual space or platform designed specifically for the sales process. It allows sales professionals to showcase products, interact with clients, and facilitate digital transactions, all without leaving your desk. DSRs are especially useful when in-person meetings are not feasible. They offer a centralized location where sales materials, presentations, and interactions can be stored, shared, and accessed, making the sales process more streamlined and efficient.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3>The Evolution of Sales through DSRs<\/h3>\n\n<p>Traditional sales methods have given way to more digital, flexible, and efficient processes, and DSRs facilitate these. This makes the sales function faster and more flexible and lets you reach clients no matter where they are.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even if a team is spread across cities or countries, DSRs like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/solutions\/digital-sales-rooms\/\">Sales Assist<\/a> can bridge the gap. It&#39;s like having a meeting room that&#39;s always open, no matter where you are. So, while the pandemic brought challenges, it also highlighted the power and potential of DSRs in keeping the sales wheel turning. However, although DSRs have become very popular, the process is not without its challenges.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-a003ccbd-7fff-6b82-9422-da1ffef65e49\">Year-over-year, demand for DSRs is up by 325%<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<h3>The Power of Real-time Notifications&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n<p>Imagine you&#39;re fishing, and the moment a fish nibbles, your rod alerts you. That&#39;s the magic of real-time notifications in DSRs. It leads to the ability to immediately engage with clients, with no more waiting or guessing. You can jump into action right away, answer questions with relevant content, or tailor your pitch to stay one step ahead in the sales game.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>From the client&#39;s perspective, it&#39;s reassuring to get immediate responses. Real-time interactions make them feel valued and heard. It&#39;s a simple touch, but it can make a world of difference in building trust and rapport.<\/p>\n\n<h3>DSR Adoption Challenges and Solutions<\/h3>\n\n<p>Change can be tough, especially when companies are used to doing things a certain way. Some of the challenges faced by companies in adopting DSRs include:<\/p>\n\n<h4>1. Resistance to Change<\/h4>\n\n<p>Sales teams, especially those accustomed to traditional methods, could be hesitant or reluctant to adopt new digital tools like Uberflip&rsquo;s <a href=\"https:\/\/help.uberflip.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360057767692-Sales-Assist-Get-started-as-a-Sales-User\">Sales Assist<\/a>. They might have concerns about the effectiveness of DSRs or view them as another tech trend that will fade away.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Use strategies like pilot testing, real-time feedback, and taking a gradual approach to adoption. Minimize resistance by starting small, such as letting a few team members try out the DSRs, gather their feedback in real time, and make tweaks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/customer-playbooks-2\/how-ecovadis-increased-their-revenue-by-200-with-personalization\">sustainability rating company EcoVadis<\/a> took a phased approach that began with aligning content across departments to ensure everyone was on the same page with the new DSR tool. This alignment helped create a cohesive strategy and reduced potential friction or confusion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h4>2. Additional Training Requirements<\/h4>\n\n<p>Implementing a new system or tool requires training. Sales teams need to get familiar with the functionalities and best practices of DSRs, which can take time and resources. Develop a structured training program that includes hands-on workshops, online tutorials, and ongoing support.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Allow sales teams to gradually become familiar with DSR functionalities and best practices, thus optimizing time and resources. Once everyone knows how to use the tools effectively, it boosts confidence and adoption rates.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h4>3. Integration with Existing Systems<\/h4>\n\n<p>DSRs might need to be integrated with other tools or platforms the sales team already uses. This can pose technical challenges and might require additional support.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Collaborate with IT to create a plan that integrates the DSR with existing tools, ensuring a smooth transition without disrupting current workflows.<\/p>\n\n<h4>4. Initial Setup and Content Alignment<\/h4>\n\n<p>Before DSRs can be fully functional, a time-consuming process is needed to set them up, populate them with the right content, and ensure alignment across departments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Assign a cross-departmental team to oversee the implementation, creating a clear roadmap that streamlines the process and reduces time consumption.<\/p>\n\n<h4>5. Overcoming Skepticism<\/h4>\n\n<p>There might be doubts about the ROI when transitioning to DSRs. Convincing higher management or stakeholders about the long-term benefits of DSRs can be a challenge.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Present clear evidence, case studies, and potential ROI projections to stakeholders to demonstrate the long-term value and strategic advantages of adopting DSRs.<\/p>\n\n<h4>6. Cultural and Behavioral Shifts<\/h4>\n\n<p>Adopting DSRs might require a shift in the company&#39;s sales culture. Sales professionals used to face-to-face interactions will need to adjust their approach and strategies in a digital environment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Implement comprehensive training and support programs that guide sales professionals in adapting to digital interactions, fostering a gradual shift in culture and behavior towards DSRs.A hands-on experience will help dispel doubts and showcase the benefits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3>Case Study: Foundant Technologies<\/h3>\n\n<p>Before implementing DSRs, <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/customer-playbooks-2\/how-foundant-generated-engagement-by-mapping-content-to-match-customer-needs\">Foundant Technologies<\/a> often missed out on timely interactions, sometimes losing potential leads.

Part of the problem is that, while budgets are squeezed and no one is buying, salespeople try harder. This means more cold calls and more stock emails than ever. But not only do these not get results, they also really frustrate the recipients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82NTAxZmUxMmNiMGJmLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWU4ZGU4YWNhNGZjMGZiZDkzMWRjZTkxZWVlZDgxNjU2\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not achieving sales results in your own organization, tactics like these might be to blame. So, what&rsquo;s a sales team to do? Is there any way to stand out today and get a buyer&rsquo;s attention? The answer is yes, by using Digital Sales Rooms (DSRs). Here&rsquo;s why, and how to do it right.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3>Disrupting a Stale Space<\/h3>\n\n<p>Until the emergence of DSRs, organizations had limited options for digital sales solutions. The main one was to use old school sales enablement tools. But, these have historically been too daunting for anyone to get anything useful from them when it comes to external communication. They&rsquo;re typically made for internal trainings, with some content that&rsquo;s flagged as okay to be distributed externally. But it takes time to scour through all the material and figure out what&rsquo;s allowed to be shared, and the actual experience it produces for buyers leaves a lot to be desired, since it was never built to be made external in the first place.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are also tools that were created specifically to be DSRs and are sold directly to sales reps. They have nice user interfaces and are easy to get started with, but reps inevitably get stuck because none of their company&rsquo;s marketing content is available for inclusion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Clearly, neither end of the spectrum is as effective as it could be, hence the need for serious disruption through modern DSRs. With this technology, sellers can create an intentionally built content experience for an external audience. In such a system, all the organization&#39;s content is discoverable and easy to surface as needed. From there, reps can use marketing-driven templates for different types of opportunities in different stages and segment accordingly. The result? Highly relevant content that&rsquo;s easily gathered and shared as an experience buyers will actually engage with.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3>The Details of Modern DSRs&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n<p>So, on a practical level, what exactly does an effective DSR look like and how does it function? To start, it&rsquo;s designed to replicate the experience of an in-person sales meeting or showroom in an online environment. While each will vary based on the industry, organization and buyer needs, DSRs typically provide a range of features and tools to support sales activities. They may include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Product or service presentations:<\/strong> Businesses can display their offerings through multimedia content such as images, videos, and interactive presentations. This helps to engage potential customers and convey the value and benefits of the products or services being sold.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Real-time communication:<\/strong> DSRs often incorporate live chat, enabling sales reps to interact with customers directly, instead of through email. This allows for personalized discussions, answering questions and addressing concerns on an ongoing basis.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Document sharing:<\/strong> Sales teams can use DSRs to provide relevant materials like brochures, catalogs, price lists or contracts to prospective customers. This streamlines the sharing of information and ensures consistency across different sales interactions.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Analytics and tracking: <\/strong>Many platforms provide analytics and tracking functionalities. Real-time notifications enable reps to engage in the moment. And analytics dashboards help their managers gather data on overall customer interactions, engagement levels, and other metrics that help companies evaluate their sales strategies, identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>DSRs Are Essential to Success<\/h3>\n\n<p>All of this rich DSR functionality serves to create an incredibly seamless customer experience that allows for great personalization and increased customer engagement. With such spaces, sales teams can offer custom-tailored content geared toward individual customers&#39; needs and preferences, enhancing engagement and showcasing value. DSRs also enable collaboration betweens sales reps and customers, fostering a sense of involvement and ownership, while leading to increased engagement and satisfaction.<\/p>\n\n<p>From a sales rep&rsquo;s perspective, DSRs are also highly valuable. They can find and organize content easily, and ensure it is relevant for prospects and in a convenient place. This will be a natural, and important, progression for organizations that already prioritize a stellar content experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>One final and very important piece of what makes DSRs so crucial is that they have longevity. The DSR can - and should - be the home base for the account throughout its entire lifetime with an organization. It should start by including some content that will interest the buyer, and can be used to appeal to the rest of the buying committee.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Then, as a potential deal progresses, the sales rep will likely pass it on to an account executive. The buyer sees new content and presentations in the same space as before, despite the contact changing on the vendor&rsquo;s end. Even when they become a customer, the AE can then transfer ownership of the DSR to a customer success representative, who continues the conversation in that same central place.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The result is an incredible trail of all the content and people that have been involved in the account, what they care about, what created engagement in the first place, who was involved, who&rsquo;s involved now and beyond. The DSR provides a history of engagement, and becomes an ongoing customer success tool, fulfilling a much grander vision than simply engaging buyers early on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>So, you want to stand out in a crowded market in which buyers are more resistant to traditional sales tactics and more reluctant to buy? DSR tools can be the best way to drive sales effectiveness and customer satisfaction, now and in the long-term.<\/p>\n"}

            "data": {"title":"How Digital Sales Rooms Can Transform B2B Sales","created_at":"22 September 2023","author":null,"content":"<p>The concept of Digital Sales Rooms (DSRs) is being embraced at lightning speed - and for good reason. The fact that they can enable buyers and stakeholders with relevant content and collateral, progressing deals with velocity, makes them sound almost too good to be true. If you&#39;re wondering how to tap into the advantages of DSRs to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in transforming B2B sales, here&#39;s what you should know.<\/p>\n\n<h3>The Sales Rep Drives Success<\/h3>\n\n<p>Salespeople typically spend their day in CRM and email, so it&rsquo;s normal to encounter a bit of resistance when you introduce them to something new. In order to win with a new tool, like DSRs, you have to show them success. If they see a spark of excitement from a teammate, they&rsquo;ll be far more willing to try it out for themselves and should be excited about the potential it offers for them too.<\/p>\n\n<p>To achieve this, DSR vendors should share these successes with new accounts and prioritize internal wins. Keep in mind that DSRs make the sales cycle easier and more effective - but using the DSR itself also has to be easy and effective. The sales rep is the linchpin behind whether a DSR succeeds or not, so put your focus on them until adoption is complete.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3>Trust is a Must<\/h3>\n\n<p>As DSRs arm sales folks with the tools they need to be more prescriptive and personalized in their outreach, they&rsquo;re also a vehicle for sales reps to show they understand what the buyer &nbsp;needs. By demonstrating an understanding of the prospect or customer&rsquo;s needs and delivering a great experience, the DSR builds trust.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, DSRs bolster the self-serve education trend among today&#39;s buyers. This is critical, as many buyers don&rsquo;t want to talk to a rep; they just want particular information. When you can provide the necessary details without making them speak to a sales rep, trust and satisfaction grow. Buyers are going to do their own research anyway; you might as well shape the narrative and proactively give them answers to their questions. If it comes down to a coin toss for them between you and your competitor, but you&#39;re the one that has facilitated their learning, you&rsquo;ll have a leg up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3>DSRs can Anchor the Entire Journey<\/h3>\n\n<p>Like any deal that happens, there are often many handoffs between marketing, sales, customer success and so on. Sometimes they work in unison, but sometimes it can be &nbsp;disjointed. A DSR can serve as the cornerstone, crafting seamless experiences for buyers throughout the entire customer lifecycle. It&rsquo;s the communication vehicle within the organization, creating a bond over time, no matter how many hands touch it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, a DSR offers much-needed visibility into the history of a buyer&rsquo;s interactions and needs with your organization. At any time, numerous stakeholders can gain insight into the evolution of a deal, from its inception to later stages, including the content and educational materials shared throughout its progression. It provides a trail of interest, conversations and content consumption patterns, which gives team members useful information to act on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>DSRs are the way of the future in B2B sales, but they&rsquo;re quickly becoming the way of the present too. To empower sales, accelerate deal velocity, and enhance buyer satisfaction, B2B organizations can utilize DSRs to cultivate trust and provide unwavering support throughout the buyer&#39;s journey with your company.<\/p>\n\n<p>To learn more and get started exploring the benefits of DSRs, visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/solutions\/digital-sales-rooms\/\">https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/solutions\/digital-sales-rooms\/<\/a>.&nbsp;<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n"}

There are plenty of opportunities and benefits this powerful technology brings, but if we&rsquo;re being honest, there are also a host of new challenges and concerns to consider.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>On one hand, B2B marketers need to embrace new technologies &ndash; like genAI &ndash; to stay competitive and evolve, so it&rsquo;s no surprise some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2023-08-23-gartner-survey-finds-63-percent-of-marketing-leaders-plan-to-invest-in-generative-ai-in-the-next-24-months\">63% of marketing leaders<\/a> plan on investing in the technology in the next 24 months. At the same time, most of us are grappling with questions like: How can we use genAI to support content creation? Can we use ChatGPT and other AI-powered tools to personalize content to reach specific audiences? And will our AI generated content still feel authentic and true to our brand?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>To help settle the dust, here are four ways B2B organizations can make the most of genAI while also staying in front of its challenges.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Content Creation<\/h2>\n\n<p>GenAI allows users to accelerate the process of content creation. Sure, the tech can speed up the writing process and give teams the ability to create massive amounts of content &mdash; faster. But how much content is too much? And is there a cost &ndash; that is the non-monetary price organizations pay &ndash; for this increased ease and experience?<\/p>\n\n<p>An argument can be made that there&rsquo;s no such thing as too much content, but content marketers and our buyers know this statement comes with a caveat. There can certainly be too much content (especially of the generic kind). However, when it comes to high-quality content, teams can always use more. If you plan on using genAI to create more content, it&rsquo;s important to assess every piece for accuracy, tone, strategy and message cohesion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Personalization<\/h2>\n\n<p>Effective B2B marketing meets prospects and buyers with personalized content when and where they need it. We know this not only builds stronger connections, it also adds value and drives results. Now comes genAI to help teams better tailor our content to specific industries, audiences and customers. It&rsquo;s important to note that this isn&rsquo;t an automatic feature. The AI you&rsquo;re using needs to be programmed &mdash; or assigned to get closer to, but not exactly &mdash; the level of personalization your team wants to provide. Remember: Only your marketing team can truly recognize the nuance required to fully personalize your content. The human touch here should not be replaced.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Marketers can also utilize genAI to determine what content is best suited for their various audiences. Teams can now personalize the content clients and buyers engage with but also determine what types of content (e.g., articles, videos, infographics, ebooks, etc.) are the best fit or achieve the highest engagement. As your team aims to capture the attention of hard-to-reach audiences, genAI can suggest and help you deliver personalized content packages rather than simply focusing on the details of headlines and intro copy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Authenticity<\/h2>\n\n<p>Technically, we as marketers can automate the entire content creation process, but should we? Definitely not without some controls in place. You might get away with it for a while, but audiences can feel the difference. That&rsquo;s the power of authenticity.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s an example, courtesy of one of today&rsquo;s most talented pop stars. Dua Lipa&rsquo;s hit &ldquo;Break My Heart&rdquo; samples from &rsquo;80s hits by Queen and INXS. The track uses every high-tech record producer trick in the book. Yet, it feels fresh, original, and authentic. Why? In part because <a href=\"https:\/\/uk.movies.yahoo.com\/chad-smith-contribution-dua-lipa-215918860.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGMQ7qGSyUbmYcJxplu3qCHYvpBbVf5NOSvho7dI3jZffNZceNSqopfZb8TmFV1W5DictclIjAFaPRiDKP05aiLOp1TbmmfMniJM80DrQyWuJYTJunBouKqSVH5MKrcM58EwxRg-4Phk-C5HFbkBxLITCCSkVhoCy7XDJU_cDOtT\">Chad Smith<\/a>, of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame, added a bit of disco-funk on live drums over the drum machine already on the track. It&rsquo;s a level of human authenticity that resonates with listeners &mdash; even if it&rsquo;s not immediately obvious. Listeners can just tell. Is it any coincidence it&rsquo;s become one of Dua Lipa&rsquo;s biggest hits?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>So, yes &ndash; genAI can generate content quickly, but it has a much harder time nailing a brand&rsquo;s authentic voice including tone, values and messaging. Temper your expectations and use it to help your team develop content. But remember: great marketing is a blend of art and science and only human marketers can ensure content is truly authentic to your brand.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Data Analysis&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s safe to say most of us would like to feel more confident in our decision-making. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/global-study-70-of-business-leaders-would-prefer-a-robot-to-make-their-decisions-301799591.html#:~:text=85%20percent%20of%20business%20leaders,percent%20want%20help%20from%20data.\">97% of employees and leaders surveyed by Oracle<\/a> say they want data to help them make faster, more informed decisions. Interestingly, 72% said their organization&rsquo;s sheer volume of data prevents any actual decision making. Fortunately, genAI can help teams cut through the noise by analyzing data, recognizing patterns and extracting insights that better inform your content strategy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>You can use AI tools to identify your audience&rsquo;s needs, preferences and behaviors by analyzing metrics such as bounce rates, click-through rates and average time on page. With the help of AI, marketing teams can speed up the process of uncovering insights from large swaths of data. The outcome of which is more targeted and effective content that drives engagement and sales.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n\n<p>AI tech, in all its forms, is changing the way we all live and work. GenAI is reshaping the way marketing teams function, which is why it&rsquo;s time to develop policy around how your team uses it. Hold space for conversations and establish expectations. Discuss how genAI tools can be used to drive messaging and sales. These conversations can inspire your organizations&rsquo; policies and practices that ensure your marketing team and audience have a clear understanding of how genAI is being leveraged to create content moving forward.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n"}

So, how can they truly stand out and get the attention of increasingly cautious buyers? One answer is better storytelling, which hinges on content. But there&rsquo;s a caveat: not all content is created equal. In fact, it must be highly relevant in order to do its job to educate and attract buyers. Here&rsquo;s why personalized content microsites can make all the difference in your storytelling efforts &mdash; and in generating demand.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Personalized is the key word<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At this point, marketers are well aware that their communications must be personalized. But, the issue is that many have a different idea of what personalization really means. For some, they think they&rsquo;ve checked the box when they&rsquo;ve stuck a prospect&rsquo;s name at the top of an email. This is far from good enough, and can often come off as being a bit creepy.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Uberflip, we define personalization very differently. It should include tailoring your communications to a prospect&rsquo;s name, company, industry, role, needs, and wants &mdash; effectively customizing the end-to-end experience. That&rsquo;s a little more in-depth than just a name, right?<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here&rsquo;s an example of personalization gone wrong. I&rsquo;m on the mailing list for a popular retailer who sent me an email saying, &ldquo;Hey Jason, you should be excited about our hot fall fashions.&rdquo; Then, the email proceeded to include (lovely) but not really my style fall dresses and cardigans. Not a fit, but they tried. And clearly, knowing my name did not make this tailored or engaging in the least. This company could have done better, and so can you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Features that boost personalization&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82NTM2ZGM2OTQ5NzZkLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTcyNjUzMjUwMmY4MmVhMTU1NjAzMGU3NzkwNjE3MzI5\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To set up your story and personalize optimally, you have to pair your content with context.

But that isn&rsquo;t the only way that technology and social media have messed things up.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Puppy-Gate effect<\/h2>\n\n<p>Think of the old analogy that &ldquo;any publicity is good publicity,&rdquo; and let&rsquo;s tweak it to say, &ldquo;Any web traffic is good web traffic.&rdquo; Is it, though? Let&rsquo;s say your company is all over the news because they decided to appoint a dog as CEO. Uh, yes&mdash;you&rsquo;d absolutely be getting more traffic. But is it good traffic? Hard no.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>That traffic is only coming to your site because they want to see where this highly-paid puppy works. You&rsquo;ll have a significant increase in overall page views, and your social media engagement will skyrocket since everyone from your aunt to your local politician is going to want to let you know exactly what they think about Puppy-Gate.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The point is that these vanity metrics absolutely don&rsquo;t matter and don&rsquo;t deserve your time.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Reviewing fluffy metrics<\/h2>\n\n<p>This brings us to the fundamental problem with vanity metrics: if the people viewing your content aren&rsquo;t potential prospects, their metrics don&rsquo;t matter. By now, you&rsquo;re probably wondering, &ldquo;Well&hellip; what are meaningful metrics then?&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>At the content level, some metrics can still provide insight into whether people are engaging in key ways. For example, Average Time on Page and Scroll Depth can tell you if people are actually reading your blog post. Bounce Rate and CTA Clicks are also pretty common ways to see if your content is converting. The problem is that these metrics still might include the wrong audience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In fact, Puppy-Gate probably killed those averages.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>You need to filter out those &ldquo;Gaters&rdquo; and focus on your target audience for more relevant analytics. To do this, you should look at how your content performs at the campaign level or, if you are an Uberflip user, at the stream level. These avenues are much more targeted&mdash;which adds context to these metrics.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of Uberflip Analytics showing item perfomance\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV82NTVjZmFlNjMyYTJjLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTNiZjViOTY1ZDY0YzNjNGE4Y2JmYjcxZDE0OTdkYzVl\" \/><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\"><small>The Single Item Performance dashboard within Uberflip allows you to see how your content is performing overall and at the individual stream level.&nbsp;<\/small><\/div>\n\n<h2>Fetching better metrics<\/h2>\n\n<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re a dog food wholesaler and have released a new data-driven report on which flavor of kibble sold best over the last year. It&rsquo;s being shared across multiple channels, as well as by your Customer Success and Sales teams. How do you know if it is performing well or not?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>If you look at overall page views, you may see some big numbers. But what is the context behind those numbers? How many of these views are grad students working on their next paper, or are pet owners that you don&rsquo;t sell directly to?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Instead, look at analytics from your campaigns that are targeted at pet stores and veterinarians. Or better yet, see how the report is being consumed by the specific chain of pet stores that are a part of your ABM efforts. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Suddenly, all those previously mentioned metrics mean so much more. These page views are from your prospects. Return Visitors represent prospects who are coming back and are interested in what you have to say.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>These numbers will be smaller, but 50 page views from a targeted ABM prospect are more valuable than 50,000 from animal lovers.<\/p>\n\n<h2>No more dog analogies&mdash;just move past vanity metrics<\/h2>\n\n<p>Simply reporting on things website page views will get you nowhere. In fact, pursuing vanity metrics can actually knock you severely off course. It can cause you to spend your time and money seeking upticks in metrics that are not going to yield you any more customers or revenue.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>So start <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/features\/analytics-reporting\/\">reporting<\/a> on things that actually matter.<\/p>\n"}

We&rsquo;ve answered some Uberflip FAQs for you below.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How does Uberflip help you create and manage content experiences?<\/h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As marketers, we generate a lot of content&mdash;videos, blogs, ebooks, podcasts, slide decks, webinars, and social posts&mdash;and deliver it across multiple channels. But because of this, we have content scattered all over the web. Using RSS feeds and integrations, Uberflip pulls all of your resources from third-party sites (like YouTube, SlideShare, and Instagram) into one place so all of your owned assets are easily accessible. Of course, you can publish content within Uberflip too!<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After centralizing your content, you&rsquo;ll need to categorize it. After all, strategic categorization is a key component of a successful, cohesive experience. With Uberflip, you can tag and organize your content by topic, persona, pain point, or account so you can build out curated experiences and recommendations that mirror a customer&rsquo;s journey.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Uberflip allows you to leverage content tags internally so that your sales and customer success teams can find and share marketing-approved content with prospects and customers based on their interests and challenges.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What does Uberflip do to accelerate buyer journeys?<\/h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your web experiences impact how customers (and future customers) view your brand and, most importantly, move through the buyer journey. With Uberflip, you can create custom collections of content and design an experience around them that encourages Netflix-style content bingeing.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Using Uberflip&rsquo;s customizable calls-to-action, you can strategically place next steps for your visitors alongside specific content assets to ensure that your prospects are moving from one piece of content to the next. Uberflip also allows you to set up AI-powered content recommendations that will serve up a panel of suggested assets based on what each unique visitor has already viewed.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you&rsquo;re asking yourself why content bingeing is so important, know that on average, people consume <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.idg.com\/blog\/7-steps-to-successful-content-marketing\/\">seven pieces of content<\/a><\/strong> before they&rsquo;re ready to make a purchase decision. So it only makes sense to give people the opportunity to consume as much relevant content as possible in order to accelerate that buyer&rsquo;s journey.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How are other companies using Uberflip?<\/h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anywhere you leverage content in your marketing is an opportunity to use an Uberflip stream. Our customers use Uberflip to power everything from their resource centers to ABM campaigns, email marketing and ad destinations, and event follow-up.

We love our IT teams, but we don&rsquo;t want to bog them down with endless requests from marketing to build out landing pages and nurture destinations every time we want to launch a campaign or send a segmented email.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here&rsquo;s a look at how your team might use Uberflip.<\/p>\n\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<li><strong>Content Marketer:<\/strong> A strategic content marketer can use Uberflip to centralize and publish content from all channels in order to <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uberflip.com\/use-cases\/content-marketing\/\">build content experiences<\/a><\/strong> that will engage customers and prospects alike.

But often marketers aren&rsquo;t leveraging their content after they click publish for their campaigns. <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/reports\/forrester-report-accelerate-your-buyers-journey-by-dynamically-curating-relevant-content\">In a recent report<\/a>, 74% of respondents said they felt confident they could identify the right accounts and 63% said they could attract them, but only 11% felt confident they could engage their buyer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That&rsquo;s where Uberflip comes in. Uberflip helps you make the most of your content by taking disparate blog articles, infographics, videos&mdash;virtually any piece of content&mdash;and creating engaging experiences and destinations for your marketing campaigns.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With Uberflip, you can create the kinds of experiences that direct leads and target accounts to the next piece of content, moving them further down the funnel along the path to education and eventual purchase. Best of all, you can discover what content attracts, engages, and compels that next action. Talk about audience insights.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But how exactly does it work? That&rsquo;s the million-dollar question.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How does Uberflip work?<\/h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The best way I&rsquo;ve heard Uberflip described is as a layer between your website and marketing automation platform (MAP).<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV81Y2Q5Y2Q0MDgxNDdlLmpwZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTYyMWIwYjU3OTQ1MjkyZDVmNWYxNjViNWU5YTI0ZWE1\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your website is the face of your product, services, and company. It houses product information, case studies, sign-up pages, sometimes an ebook or two. And as a marketer, it&rsquo;s a bit cumbersome to update&mdash;you usually need a developer to do so&mdash;but it works because you&rsquo;re not making changes all that often.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Because websites are a pain to update, most marketers have a blog hosted on a CMS like WordPress so they can publish content as often as they like.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Uberflip doesn&rsquo;t replace your blog (although it can also do that); it works alongside it. Uberflip makes all your blog content&mdash;as well as your marketing content (such as ebooks, whitepapers, and webinar recordings) that is far too often hidden, homeless, or collecting dust in the deep corners of your servers somewhere&mdash;much more surfaceable, shareable, usable, and, most importantly, effective.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How? By allowing marketers (that&rsquo;s you!) to publish that content quickly, package it up however you like for ABM and demand generation campaigns, and capture lead data right alongside your top performing blogs by integrating with your MAP...<a href=\"https:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/blog\/why-your-cms-wont-cut-it\">something your CMS can&rsquo;t do<\/a>,&nbsp;and your IT team sure as heck won&rsquo;t want to do on your website. But when you add Uberflip to your tech stack, you won&rsquo;t need them to.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With Uberflip, you can ensure website visitors can access all your best (and latest) marketing content through the top-line navigation on your site, providing a seamless experience from website to content library. Finally, because Uberflip and your website play well together, you can engage website visitors about to bounce by serving up your supreme marketing content directly on the page.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a layer between your website and your MAP, Uberflip is truly a tool built for marketers that allows marketing teams the autonomy to both create and manage brilliant content experiences, direct and accelerate buyer journeys, and build rich lead scoring models based on content consumption data and audience insights.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How do you use Uberflip?<\/h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Uberflip is a <a href=\"http:\/\/hub.uberflip.com\/uberflip-blog-posts\/what-is-content-experience-definition\" target=\"_blank\">content experience platform<\/a> (CEP) that enables marketers to take content and package it into digital experiences relevant to target audiences. When we say &ldquo;experiences,&rdquo; we&rsquo;re most often talking about destinations or collections of content, like this:<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV81Y2Q5Yjc1ZjBhMzZiLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTE4Mjg3MzlhODY1YTc5MDdhN2I3MzUwYWIxZGIxNjg3\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the above example, we curated this collection of content and sent it to attendees of a webinar we ran.

That&rsquo;s what we call personalized, relevant, and valuable post-webinar follow-up!<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But when we refer to content experiences, they can take on many forms:<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like this one for your post-event follow-up.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV81Y2Q5Yjc4MTI4YmQ0LnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWM3YTM4ZTNmODE1MWU4YTk2NWExODkyNGZhNDdiMTc4\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Or this nurture destination for your nurture campaigns&hellip;<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV81Y2Q5Yjc5ODkxMGMwLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPTVhZDQ2Mzk2ZjUzYTU1NDhjYWVlNzI1NGU5ZmIyN2Fh\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Or a content hub for your inbound marketing...<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/content.cdntwrk.com\/files\/aHViPTIxOCZjbWQ9aXRlbWVkaXRvcmltYWdlJmZpbGVuYW1lPWl0ZW1lZGl0b3JpbWFnZV81Y2Q5Yjg2OTJiYzdhLnBuZyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTAwMDAmc2lnPWExNzAxZGMxNmZlZThkMGViMzBlOTkzZjk4MTE2ZjU2\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These are just a few examples to help you understand what we mean when we refer to content experiences or destinations.
